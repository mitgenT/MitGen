## Docstring:
"""
Monocarp is participating in a programming contest, which features 26 problems, named from 'A' to 'Z'. The problems are sorted by difficulty. Moreover, it's known that Monocarp can solve problem 'A' in 1 minute, problem 'B' in 2 minutes, ..., problem 'Z' in 26 minutes.

After the contest, you discovered his contest log — a string, consisting of uppercase Latin letters, such that the 𝑖 -th letter tells which problem Monocarp was solving during the 𝑖 -th minute of the contest. If Monocarp had spent enough time in total on a problem to solve it, he solved it. Note that Monocarp could have been thinking about a problem after solving it.

Given Monocarp's contest log, calculate the number of problems he solved during the contest.

Input

The first line contains a single integer 𝑡 (1≤𝑡≤100 ) — the number of testcases. 

The first line of each testcase contains a single integer 𝑛 (1≤𝑛≤500 ) — the duration of the contest, in minutes. 

The second line contains a string of length exactly 𝑛, consisting only of uppercase Latin letters, — Monocarp's contest log.

Output

For each testcase, print a single integer — the number of problems Monocarp solved during the contest.
