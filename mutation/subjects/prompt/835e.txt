"""
You are given a binary array of length 𝑛. You are allowed to perform one operation on it at most once. In an operation, you can choose any element and flip it: turn a 0 into a 1 or vice-versa.
What is the maximum number of inversions the array can have after performing at most one operation?
A binary array is an array that contains only zeroes and ones.
The number of inversions in an array is the number of pairs of indices 𝑖,𝑗 such that 𝑖<𝑗 and 𝑎𝑖>𝑎𝑗.

Input
The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer 𝑡 (1≤𝑡≤10^4) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains an integer 𝑛 (1≤𝑛≤2⋅10^5) — the length of the array.
The following line contains 𝑛 space-separated positive integers 𝑎1 , 𝑎2 ,..., 𝑎𝑛 (0≤𝑎𝑖≤1) — the elements of the array.
It is guaranteed that the sum of 𝑛 over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.

Output
For each test case, output a single integer  — the maximum number of inversions the array can have after performing at most one operation.
