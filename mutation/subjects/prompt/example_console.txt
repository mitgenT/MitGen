Your task is to perform infilling for a given code. Specifically, you need to infill <MASK> in given code based on the its docstring. You only need to output the code to be infilled to <MASK>. I will show you one examples first.

# Example

## Docstring:
"""
The program implements a bubble-sortã€‚
"""

## Given code:
```Python
def program(list1):  
    for i in range(0,len(list1)-1):  
        for j in range(len(list1)-1):  
            if(list1[j]>list1[j+1]):  
                temp = list1[j]  
                <MASK>
                list1[j+1] = temp  
    return list1  
```

## Output
```Python
                list1[j] = list1[j+1]
```
