'''
There are n quests. If you complete the i-th quest, you will gain ai coins. You can only complete at most one quest per day. However, once you complete a quest, you cannot do the same quest again for k days. (For example, if k=2 and you do quest 1 on day 1, then you cannot do it on day 2 or 3, but you can do it again on day 4.)

You are given two integers c and d. Find the maximum value of k such that you can gain at least c coins over d days. If no such k exists, output Impossible. If k can be arbitrarily large, output Infinity.

Input
The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t(1<=t≤10^4) - the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n,c,d(2<=n<=2⋅10^5; 1<=c<=10^16; 1<=d<=2⋅10^5) - the number of quests, the number of coins you need, and the number of days.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a1,a2,…,an (1<=ai<=10^9) - the rewards for the quests.

The sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5, and the sum of d over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.

Output
For each test case, output one of the following.

If no such k exists, output Impossible.
If k can be arbitrarily large, output Infinity.
Otherwise, output a single integer - the maximum value of k such that you can gain at least c coins over d days. 

Please note, the checker is case-sensitive, and you should output strings exactly as they are given.
