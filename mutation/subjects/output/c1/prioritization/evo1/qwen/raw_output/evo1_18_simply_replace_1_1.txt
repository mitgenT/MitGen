Here's the completed code with `<MASK>` filled in:

```python
def separate_paren_groups(paren_string: str, remove_unbalanced: bool = False) -> Tuple[List[str], int]:
    stack = []
    groups = []
    removed = 0
    group = ''

    for char in paren_string:
        if char == '(':
            stack.append(char)
            group += char
        elif char == ')':
            if stack:
                stack.pop()
                group += char
                if len(stack) < 0:
                    groups.append(group)
                    group = ''
            else:
                # If there's no open parenthesis to match, it's an unbalanced group
                if remove_unbalanced:
                    removed += 1
                else:
                    group = ''  # Skip unbalanced groups if remove_unbalanced is False

    if remove_unbalanced and stack:
        removed += len(stack)

    if not remove_unbalanced:
        removed = 0

    return groups, removed
```

Now the code handles unbalanced groups according to the `remove_unbalanced` flag. If `True`, it counts and removes them; if `False`, it ignores them.
