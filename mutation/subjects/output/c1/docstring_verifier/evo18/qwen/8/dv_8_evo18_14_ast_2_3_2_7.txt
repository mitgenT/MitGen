def how_many_times(string: str, substrings: list) -> dict:
    """
    This function calculates the frequency of each provided substring within the original string, considering overlapping instances. It returns a dictionary with substrings as keys and their respective counts. If any empty string is encountered, it responds with "Substrings cannot be empty." An empty input string yields a dictionary with zeros for all substrings. If a substring appears multiple times in the input list, its count increments accordingly. Examples:
    1. For an empty string and one substring: {'a': 0}
    2. For 'aaa' and 'a' twice: {'a': 6}
    3. For 'aaaa' and 'aa' and 'a': {'aa': 3, 'a': 4}
    4. For 'abcabc' and all three letters: {'a': 2, 'b': 2, 'c': 2}
