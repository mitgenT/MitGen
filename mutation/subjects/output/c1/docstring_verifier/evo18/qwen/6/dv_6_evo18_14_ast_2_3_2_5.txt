def how_many_times(string: str, substrings: list) -> dict:
    """
    This function computes the frequency of each provided substring within the original string, considering overlapping occurrences.
    It returns a dictionary with substrings as keys and their respective counts. If an empty substring is encountered, it responds with "Substrings cannot be empty."
    An empty input string yields a dictionary with zero counts for all substrings. If a substring appears multiple times in the input list, its count increases accordingly.
    Examples:
    1. For an empty string and a single substring: {'a': 0}
    2. For 'aaa' and 'a' repeated twice: {'a': 6}
    3. For 'aaaa' with 'aa' and 'a': {'aa': 3, 'a': 4}
    4. For 'abcabc' with all three letters: {'a': 2, 'b': 2, 'c': 2}
