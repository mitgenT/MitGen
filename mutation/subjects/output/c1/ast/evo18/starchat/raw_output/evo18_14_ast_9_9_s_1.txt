## Output:
```python
def how_many_times(string: str, substrings: list) -> dict:
    if any(sub == '' for sub in substrings):
        return "Substrings cannot be empty"
    result = {sub: 0 for sub in substrings}
    for sub in substrings:
        start = 0
        while start < len(string) - 1:
            pos = string.find(sub, start)
            if pos!= -1:
                result[sub] += 1
                start = pos + 1
            else:
                break
    return result
```
In the given program, we have filled the <MASK> with an 'if' condition to check if the result of string.find() is not -1 before incrementing the substring count and updating the start position. This ensures that we count overlapping cases as per the given requirement.
