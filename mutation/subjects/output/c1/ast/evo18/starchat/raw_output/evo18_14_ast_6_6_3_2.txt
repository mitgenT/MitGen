## Output
```python
def how_many_times(string: str, substrings: list) -> dict:
    if any(sub == '' for sub in substrings):
        return "Substrings cannot be empty"
    result = {sub: 0 for sub in substrings}
    for sub in substrings:
        if len(sub) == 0:
            return "Substrings cannot be empty"
        start = 0
        while start < len(string) - 1:
            pos = string.find(sub, start)
            if pos!= -1:
                result[sub] += 1
                start = pos + len(sub)
            else:
                break
    return result
```
In this solution, the code now handles the case of empty substrings. The `<MASK>` has been replaced with a conditional check to verify the length of each substring before searching for it in the main string. Additionally, the `start` index is updated to `pos + len(sub)` to account for overlapping cases.
