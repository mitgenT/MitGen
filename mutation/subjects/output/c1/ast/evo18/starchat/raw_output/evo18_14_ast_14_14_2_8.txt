## Output
```python
def how_many_times(string: str, substrings: list) -> dict:
    if any(sub == '' for sub in substrings):
        return "Substrings cannot be empty"
    result = {sub: 0 for sub in substrings}
    for sub in substrings:
        start = 0
        while start < len(string) - 1:
            pos = string.find(sub, start)
            if pos!= -1:
                result[sub] += 1
                start = pos + len(sub)  # Update the start position with the length of the substring
            else:
                break
    return result

```
In this output, the `<MASK>` has been replaced with `start = pos + len(sub)`. This line ensures that overlapping cases are properly counted in the final result.
