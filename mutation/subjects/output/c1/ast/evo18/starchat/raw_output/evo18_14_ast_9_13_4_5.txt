## Output

```python
def how_many_times(string: str, substrings: list) -> dict:
    if any(sub == '' for sub in substrings):
        return "Substrings cannot be empty"
    result = {sub: 0 for sub in substrings}
    for sub in substrings:
        start = 0
        while start < len(string) - 1:
            pos = string.find(sub, start)
            if pos == -1:  # sub not found, break the loop
                break
            result[sub] += 1  # increase the count
            start = pos + 1  # continue search from next index
    return result
```

This updated code increases the count of each found substring and continues searching from the next index, allowing overlapping cases to be counted as well. If a substring is not found, it will break the loop for that substring and continue with the next one.
