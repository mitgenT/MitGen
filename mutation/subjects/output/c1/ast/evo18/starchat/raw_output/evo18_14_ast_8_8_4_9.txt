## Output
```python
def how_many_times(string: str, substrings: list) -> dict:
    if any(sub == '' for sub in substrings):
        return "Substrings cannot be empty"
    result = {sub: 0 for sub in substrings}
    for sub in substrings:
        start = 0
        while start < len(string) - 1:
            if string.startswith(sub, start):
                pos = start
            if pos!= -1:
                result[sub] += 1
                start = pos + 1
            else:
                break
    return result
```
I have filled <MASK> with the appropriate Python functions and logic to count the occurrences of substrings in the given string, considering overlapping cases. The updated code meets the requested docstring specifications.
