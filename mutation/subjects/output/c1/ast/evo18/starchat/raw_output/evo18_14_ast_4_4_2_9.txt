## Output
```python
def how_many_times(string: str, substrings: list) -> dict:
    if any(sub == '' for sub in substrings):
        return "Substrings cannot be empty"
    if string == "":
        result = {sub: 0 for sub in substrings}
    else:
        result = {sub: string.count(sub) for sub in substrings}
    return result
```

In the example above, the code is filled with the <MASK> to achieve the desired behavior. The first <MASK> checks if the input string is empty and initializes the result dictionary accordingly. The second <MASK> uses the `string.count` method to count the occurrences of each substring in the original string.
