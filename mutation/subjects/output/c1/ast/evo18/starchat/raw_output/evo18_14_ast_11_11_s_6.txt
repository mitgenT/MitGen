```python
def how_many_times(string: str, substrings: list) -> dict:
    if any(sub == '' for sub in substrings):
        return "Substrings cannot be empty"
    result = {sub: 0 for sub in substrings}
    for sub in substrings:
        start = 0
        while start < len(string) - 1:
            pos = string.find(sub, start)
            if pos!= -1:
                result[sub] += 1
                if len(sub) > 1:
                    start = pos + 1
            else:
                break
    return result
```
I infilled <MASK> with a conditional statement to consider overlapping cases only if the length of the substring is greater than 1. This ensures that overlapping cases are counted correctly in the program.
