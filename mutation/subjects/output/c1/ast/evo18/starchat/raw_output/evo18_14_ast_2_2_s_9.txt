## Output

```python
def how_many_times(string: str, substrings: list) -> dict:
    if not substrings:
        return "Substrings cannot be empty"
    result = {sub: 0 for sub in substrings}
    for sub in substrings:
        start = 0
        while start < len(string) - 1:
            pos = string.find(sub, start)
            if pos!= -1:
                result[sub] += 1
                start = pos + len(sub)
            else:
                break
    return result
```
In the revised code, in the <MASK> area, I added a conditional check that returns "Substrings cannot be empty" if an empty substring is found. For counting overlapping cases, I updated the `start` position to be `pos + len(sub)` after each successful substring match, instead of `pos + 1`. This ensures that the algorithm looks for the next occurrence of the substring starting from the correct position.
