```python
def how_many_times(string: str, substrings: list) -> dict:
    if any(sub == '' for sub in substrings):
        return "Substrings cannot be empty"
    result = {sub: 0 for sub in substrings}
    for sub in substrings:
        start = 0
        while True:
            pos = string.find(sub, start)
            if pos!= -1:
                result[sub] += 1
                start = pos + len(sub)
            else:
                break
    return result
```

In the given `how_many_times` function, I replaced the `<MASK>` with a `while True` loop to handle overlapping cases. The loop continues to find the position of the substring in the original string using the `string.find` method starting from the last found position (plus the length of the substring). If the position is not -1 (indicating that the substring is found), we increment the count for the substring and update the starting position. If the position is -1, we break the loop to avoid an infinite loop. This approach ensures that overlapping cases are also counted correctly.
