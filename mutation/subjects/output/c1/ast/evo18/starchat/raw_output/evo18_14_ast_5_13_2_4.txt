```python
def how_many_times(string: str, substrings: list) -> dict:
    if any(sub == '' for sub in substrings):
        return "Substrings cannot be empty"
    result = {sub: 0 for sub in substrings}
    for sub in substrings:
        while sub in string:
            string = string.replace(sub, '', 1)
            result[sub] += 1
    return result

```
I filled in <MASK> with a while loop that will continue replacing the given substring in the original string and increase the count until the substring is no longer found.
