```python
def how_many_times(string: str, substrings: list) -> dict:
    if any(sub == '' for sub in substrings):
        return "Substrings cannot be empty"
    result = {sub: 0 for sub in substrings}
    for sub in substrings:
        start = 0
        while start < len(string) - 1:
            pos = string.find(sub, start)
            if pos!= -1:
                result[sub] += 1
                start = pos + len(sub)
            else:
                break
    return result
```
In this solution, the <MASK> is replaced by incrementing the count of the substring in the dictionary `result` and then updating the starting position (`start`) to skip the already counted occurrence of the substring. This ensures that overlapping occurrences are counted.
