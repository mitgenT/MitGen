## Output

```python
def how_many_times(string: str, substrings: list) -> dict:
    if any(sub == '' for sub in substrings):
        return "Substrings cannot be empty"
    result = {sub: 0 for sub in substrings}
    for sub in substrings:
        start = 0
        while start < len(string) - 1:
            pos = string.find(sub, start)
            if pos!= -1:
                result[sub] += 1
                start = pos + len(sub)
            else:
                break
    return result
```
The <MASK> was replaced with `start = pos + len(sub)` to update the starting position for the next search in the case that a substring is found, which is needed for considering overlapping cases.
