The problem is asking to infer the missing parts of the code, based on the given code and docstring. The missing parts should be inferred based on the docstring specifications.

From the docstring, we can infer that the first <MASK> should check if any substring is an empty string. The second <MASK> should check if the string is empty.

The python code with the infilled <MASK> is below:

```python
def how_many_times(string: str, substrings: list) -> dict:
    if any(sub == '' for sub in substrings):
        return "Substrings cannot be empty"
    if string == '':
        return {sub: 0 for sub in substrings}
    result = {sub: 0 for sub in substrings}
    for sub in substrings:
        start = 0
        while start < len(string) - 1:
            pos = string.find(sub, start)
            if pos != -1:
                result[sub] += 1
                start = pos + 1
            else:
                break
    return result
```

This function works by creating a dictionary to count the occurrences of each substring, and iterating through the string, incrementing the count each time a substring is found. If a substring is an empty string, the function will return an error message. If the input string is empty, the function will return a dictionary with zero counts for each substring.
