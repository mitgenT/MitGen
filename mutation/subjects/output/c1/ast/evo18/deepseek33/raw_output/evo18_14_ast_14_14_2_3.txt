The output can be obtained by simply removing the trailing "<MASK>" which serves no purpose. The docstring, in Python, can be used for documenting the purpose of the code, but is completely ignored by Python itself. Hence, the given code without <MASK> would simply be:

```python
def how_many_times(string: str, substrings: list) -> dict:
    if any(sub == '' for sub in substrings):
        return "Substrings cannot be empty"
    result = {sub: 0 for sub in substrings}
    for sub in substrings:
        start = 0
        while start < len(string) - 1:
            pos = string.find(sub, start)
            if pos != -1:
                result[sub] += 1
                start = pos + 1
            else:
                break
```
