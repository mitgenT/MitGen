In this problem, we need to insert a line of code that advances the `start` variable after each occurrence of the substring is found. We can do this by incrementing the `start` variable by 1. 

Here is the completed code:

```python
def how_many_times(string: str, substrings: list) -> dict:
    if any(sub == '' for sub in substrings):
        return "Substrings cannot be empty"
    result = {sub: 0 for sub in substrings}
    for sub in substrings:
        start = 0
        while start < len(string) - 1:
            pos = string.find(sub, start)
            if pos != -1:
                result[sub] += 1
                start += 1
            else:
                break
    return result
```
