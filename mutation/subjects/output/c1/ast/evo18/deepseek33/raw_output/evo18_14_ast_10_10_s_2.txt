Based on the given context, the code snippet to infill the <MASK> should add the length of the substring to the count of that substring in the 'result' dictionary. 

Here is the completed program:

```python
def how_many_times(string: str, substrings: list) -> dict:
    if any(sub == '' for sub in substrings):
        return "Substrings cannot be empty"
    result = {sub: 0 for sub in substrings}
    for sub in substrings:
        start = 0
        while start < len(string) - 1:
            pos = string.find(sub, start)
            if pos != -1:
                result[sub] += len(sub)
                start = pos + 1
            else:
                break
    return result
```
The `len(sub)` operation is used to get the length of each found substring and add it to the count of that substring in the 'result' dictionary.
