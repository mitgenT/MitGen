The <MASK> portion of the code can be replaced with the following:

```python
if pos == -1:
    break
```

Here is the complete code:

```python
def how_many_times(string: str, substrings: list) -> dict:
    if any(sub == '' for sub in substrings):
        return "Substrings cannot be empty"
    result = {sub: 0 for sub in substrings}
    for sub in substrings:
        start = 0
        while start < len(string) - 1:
            pos = string.find(sub, start)
            if pos != -1:
                result[sub] += 1
                start = pos + 1
            if pos == -1:
                break
    return result
```

This code correctly counts how many times each substring in the list appears in the string, handling the case where a substring is an empty string or if the string is empty.
