The infill for the missing part of the given code could be:

```python
for sub in substrings:
    start = 0
    while start < len(string):
        start = string.find(sub, start)
        if start == -1: break
        result[sub] += 1
        start += 1
```

This code uses the find method of the string to find all occurrences of a substring in the input string and counts them in the result dictionary. It starts searching from the last found position for each substring. The loop breaks when find method cannot find any more occurrences of the substring. 

The final program would look like this:

```python
def how_many_times(string: str, substrings: list) -> dict:
    if any(sub == '' for sub in substrings):
        return "Substrings cannot be empty"
    result = {sub: 0 for sub in substrings}
    for sub in substrings:
        start = 0
        while start < len(string):
            start = string.find(sub, start)
            if start == -1: break
            result[sub] += 1
            start += 1
    return result
```
