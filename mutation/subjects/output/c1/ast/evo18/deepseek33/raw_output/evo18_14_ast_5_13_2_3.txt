```python
def how_many_times(string: str, substrings: list) -> dict:
    if any(sub == '' for sub in substrings):
        return "Substrings cannot be empty"
    result = {sub: 0 for sub in substrings}
    for sub in substrings:
        idx = 0
        while idx < len(string):
            idx = string.find(sub, idx)
            if idx == -1:
                break
            else:
                result[sub] += 1
                idx += 1
    return result
```
This solution loops over each substring in the input list and uses the `find` method to search for occurrences in the input string, starting from the last found index. If it finds an occurrence, it increments the count for that substring. It breaks the loop if no occurrence is found.
