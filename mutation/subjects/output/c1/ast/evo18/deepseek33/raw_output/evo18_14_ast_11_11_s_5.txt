## Output:
```python
def how_many_times(string: str, substrings: list) -> dict:
    if any(sub == '' for sub in substrings):
        return "Substrings cannot be empty"
    result = {sub: 0 for sub in substrings}
    for sub in substrings:
        start = 0
        while start < len(string) - 1:
            pos = string.find(sub, start)
            if pos != -1:
                result[sub] += 1
                start = pos + 1  # Move the starting position to the next character after the found substring
            else:
                break
    return result
```
In the given code, the two <MASK> should be replaced with `start = pos + 1`. The starting position `start` needs to be moved to the next character after the found substring. Otherwise, the program would become an infinite loop in some situations.
