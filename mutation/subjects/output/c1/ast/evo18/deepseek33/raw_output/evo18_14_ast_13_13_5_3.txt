The code to be infilled in the given context could be `else: break`. The purpose of this is to break out of the loop when the substring no longer appears in the rest of the string, which prevents the function from searching the entire string for the substring unnecessarily.

```python
def how_many_times(string: str, substrings: list) -> dict:
    if any(sub == '' for sub in substrings):
        return "Substrings cannot be empty"
    result = {sub: 0 for sub in substrings}
    for sub in substrings:
        start = 0
        while start < len(string) - 1:
            pos = string.find(sub, start)
            if pos != -1:
                result[sub] += 1
                start = pos + 1
            else:
                break
    return result
```
