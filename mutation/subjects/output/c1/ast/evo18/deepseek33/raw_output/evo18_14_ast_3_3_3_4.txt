Here is how to infill the <MASK>:

```python
def how_many_times(string: str, substrings: list) -> dict:
    if any(sub == '' for sub in substrings):
        return "Substrings cannot be empty"
    if string == "":
        return {sub: 0 for sub in substrings}
    result = {sub: 0 for sub in substrings}
    for sub in substrings:
        start = 0
        while start < len(string) - 1:
            pos = string.find(sub, start)
            if pos != -1:
                result[sub] += 1
                start = pos + 1
            else:
                break
    return result
```

Note: The if condition "<MASK>" is replaced by "if string == "":" and the else block "<MASK>" is replaced by "return {sub: 0 for sub in substrings}". This code checks if the given string is empty. If so, it will return a dictionary with zero counts for each substring.
