The infilled code to replace `<MASK>` in the given code is as follows:

```python
def how_many_times(string: str, substrings: list) -> dict:
    if any(sub == '' for sub in substrings):
        return "Substrings cannot be empty"
    result = {sub: 0 for sub in substrings}
    for sub in substrings:
        start = 0
        while start < len(string) - 1:
            pos = string.find(sub, start)
            if pos != -1:
                start = pos + 1
                result[sub] += 1
            else:
                break
    return result

```

The given code is using the `find()` function of a string to find the first occurrence of a substring from a string starting from a specific position (`start`). If the substring is found, we increment the corresponding count in `result` dictionary. If it isn't found (`find()` returns -1), we break the loop. The `start` variable keeps track of the position to start searching from.
