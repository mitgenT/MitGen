In this case, the code in the `<MASK>` can be infilled with the lines of code that would increment the count of the substring if it is found in the string.

```python
def how_many_times(string: str, substrings: list) -> dict:
    if any(sub == '' for sub in substrings):
        return "Substrings cannot be empty"
    result = {sub: 0 for sub in substrings}
    for sub in substrings:
        start = 0
        while start < len(string) - 1:
            pos = string.find(sub, start)
            if pos != -1:  # substring is found in string
                result[sub] += string.count(sub)  # increase count by the number of times substring occurs in string
                start = pos + 1  # start from next character after the found substring
            else:  # substring is not found
                break
    return result
```
