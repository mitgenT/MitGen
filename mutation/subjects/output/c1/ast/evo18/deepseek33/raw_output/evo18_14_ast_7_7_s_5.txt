The first missing part of the code in the provided example is to assign the value of `list1[j+1]` to `list1[j]` and the second missing part is to assign the value of `temp` to `list1[j+1]`. Therefore, the full program should be:

```Python
def program(list1):  
    for i in range(0,len(list1)-1):  
        for j in range(len(list1)-1):  
            if(list1[j]>list1[j+1]):  
                temp = list1[j]  
                list1[j] = list1[j+1]
                list1[j+1] = temp  
    return list1  
```

For the second given code, the first missing part is to initialize the `start` variable before the while loop and the second missing part is to increment the `start` variable inside the while loop. Therefore, the full code should be:

```Python
def how_many_times(string: str, substrings: list) -> dict:
    if any(sub == '' for sub in substrings):
        return "Substrings cannot be empty"
    result = {sub: 0 for sub in substrings}
    for sub in substrings:
        start = 0
        while start < len(string):
            pos = string.find(sub, start)
            if pos != -1:
                result[sub] += 1
                start = pos + 1
            else:
                break
    return result
```
