Here's the complete code after infilling <MASK> based on the docstring:

```python
def how_many_times(string: str, substrings: list) -> dict:
    if any(sub == '' for sub in substrings):
        return "Substrings cannot be empty"
    result = {sub: 0 for sub in substrings}
    for sub in substrings:
        if sub in string:
            result[sub] = string.count(sub)
    return result
```

This code defines a function `how_many_times` which takes a string and a list of substrings as input. It first checks if any of the substrings are empty. If so, it returns the error message "Substrings cannot be empty". If not, it initializes a dictionary `result` with keys as the substrings and values as 0. Then it counts the occurrences of each substring in the string and stores the count in the dictionary `result`. Finally, it returns the dictionary `result`.
