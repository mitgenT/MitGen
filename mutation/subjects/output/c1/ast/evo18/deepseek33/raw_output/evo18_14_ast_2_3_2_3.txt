Based on the docstring, it's obvious that the code inside the mask is needed to check if a substring is an empty string. Here's how we can accomplish it:

## Infilled Code
```python
def how_many_times(string: str, substrings: list) -> dict:
    # Check if any substring is an empty string
    for sub in substrings:
        if not sub:
            return "Substrings cannot be empty"
    
    result = {sub: 0 for sub in substrings}
    for sub in substrings:
        start = 0
        while start < len(string) - 1:
            pos = string.find(sub, start)
            if pos != -1:
                result[sub] += 1
                start = pos + 1
            else:
                break
    return result
```
