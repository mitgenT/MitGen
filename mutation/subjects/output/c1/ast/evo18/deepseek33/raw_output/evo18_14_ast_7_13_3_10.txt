The infilled code should have two masks. The first is replacing `<MASK>` within the `if` statement and replacing with `string == ''`. The second mask is replacing `<MASK>` within the `for` loop and replacing with `start < len(string)`. This is because we need to loop through each character in the string, and when we've gone through every character, we know we're done.

```python
def how_many_times(string: str, substrings: list) -> dict:
    if any(sub == '' for sub in substrings):
        return "Substrings cannot be empty"
    result = {sub: 0 for sub in substrings}
    for sub in substrings:
        start = 0
        while start < len(string):
            start = string.find(sub, start)
            if start == -1:
                break
            else:
                result[sub] += 1
                start += 1
    return result
```
