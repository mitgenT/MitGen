The code to replace the `<MASK>` can be to make the inner loop run until the entire string length is covered. This is needed to find overlapping occurrences of the substring in the string.

Here is the code with `<MASK>` infilled:

```python
def how_many_times(string: str, substrings: list) -> dict:
    if any(sub == '' for sub in substrings):
        return "Substrings cannot be empty"
    result = {sub: 0 for sub in substrings}
    for sub in substrings:
        start = 0
        while start < len(string):
            pos = string.find(sub, start)
            if pos != -1:
                result[sub] += 1
                start = pos + 1
            else:
                break
    return result
```
