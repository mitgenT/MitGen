The "<MASK>" in the given code should be filled as follows:

```python
def how_many_times(string: str, substrings: list) -> dict:
    if any(sub == '' for sub in substrings):
        return "Substrings cannot be empty"
    result = {sub: 0 for sub in substrings}
    for sub in substrings:
        start = 0
        while start < len(string):
            pos = string.find(sub, start)
            if pos != -1:
                result[sub] += 1
                start = pos + 1
            else:
                break
    return result
```
In this corrected code, "<MASK>" has been replaced by "while start < len(string):" which is used to ensure that the loop continues until the entire string has been checked. Inside the loop, the code has been corrected by adding "start = pos + 1" to move the starting index for the next search to one position after the found substring, and by adding "if pos != -1:" to check if the substring is found in the string. If not, it breaks the loop.
