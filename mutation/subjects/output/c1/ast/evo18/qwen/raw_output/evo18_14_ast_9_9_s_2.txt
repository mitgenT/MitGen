Based on the provided docstring, the function `how_many_times` should count overlapping occurrences of substrings in the input string `string`. Here's the code with `<MASK>` filled in:

```python
def how_many_times(string: str, substrings: list) -> dict:
    if any(sub == '' for sub in substrings):
        return "Substrings cannot be empty"
    result = {sub: 0 for sub in substrings}
    for sub in substrings:
        start = 0
        while start < len(string) - len(sub):  # Adjust the condition to avoid index out of range
            pos = string.find(sub, start)
            if pos != -1:  # Check if the substring is found, not -1 (not found)
                string = string[pos + 1:]  # Skip the found substring to check for overlapping occurrences
                result[sub] += 1
                start = 0  # Reset the start position after finding a match
            else:
                break
    return result
```

Now the code should work as expected according to the given docstring examples.
