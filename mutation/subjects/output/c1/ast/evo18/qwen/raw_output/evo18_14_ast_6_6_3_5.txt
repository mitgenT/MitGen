Here's the filled-in code based on the given docstring:

```python
def how_many_times(string: str, substrings: list) -> dict:
    if any(sub == '' for sub in substrings):
        return "Substrings cannot be empty"
    result = {sub: 0 for sub in substrings}
    for sub in substrings:
        start = 0
        if start < len(string) - 1:  # Check for overlapping occurrences
            while start < len(string) - 1:
                pos = string.find(sub, start)
                if pos != -1:
                    result[sub] += 1
                    start = pos + 1
                else:
                    break
        else:
            continue  # Skip the check for an empty string at the end of the string
    return result
```

Explanation: The `<MASK>` sections have been replaced with logic to find overlapping occurrences of the substring `sub` in the `string`. The `start` variable is used to track the position for the next search. If `start` is less than the length of the string minus one, it continues searching for the substring; otherwise, it breaks the loop when reaching the end of the string.
