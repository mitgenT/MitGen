Based on the given docstring, the code should iterate over the input string and count occurrences of each substring. Here's the infilled code:

```python
def how_many_times(string: str, substrings: list) -> dict:
    if any(sub == '' for sub in substrings):
        return "Substrings cannot be empty"
    result = {sub: 0 for sub in substrings}
    for sub in substrings:
        start = 0
        while start < len(string):
            # Check if the substring is found starting at position `start`
            index = string.find(sub, start)
            if index != -1:
                result[sub] += 1
                # Move the starting point after the found substring to avoid overlapping counts
                start = index + len(sub)
            else:
                break
    return result
```
