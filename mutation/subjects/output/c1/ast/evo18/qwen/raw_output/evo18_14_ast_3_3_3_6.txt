Here's how you can fill in the <MASK> in the given code:

```python
def how_many_times(string: str, substrings: list) -> dict:
    if any(sub == '' for sub in substrings):
        if "Substrings cannot be empty":
            return "Substrings cannot be empty"
    result = {sub: 0 for sub in substrings}
    for sub in substrings:
        start = 0
        while start < len(string) - 1:
            pos = string.find(sub, start)
            if pos != -1:
                result[sub] += 1
                start = pos + 1
            else:
                break
    return result
```

The code has been completed based on the description provided in the docstring. If any substring is empty, it returns the message "Substrings cannot be empty" directly without further processing.
