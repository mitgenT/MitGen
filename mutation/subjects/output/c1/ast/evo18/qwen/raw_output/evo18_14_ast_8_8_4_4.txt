Based on the provided docstring, the code is looking for occurrences of each substring in the input string. It seems like it's using a loop to iterate over the string and check for substring matches. Here's how to fill in the `<MASK>` parts:

```python
def how_many_times(string: str, substrings: list) -> dict:
    if any(sub == '' for sub in substrings):
        return "Substrings cannot be empty"
    result = {sub: 0 for sub in substrings}
    for sub in substrings:
        start = 0
        while start < len(string) - len(sub) + 1:  # Adjust the end condition to avoid out-of-bounds errors
            if string[start:start+len(sub)] == sub:  # Check if the substring is present at the current start position
                pos = string.find(sub, start)  # Find the next occurrence starting from the current position
                result[sub] += 1
                start = pos + 1
            else:
                break
    return result
```

Now, the code checks for substring occurrences within the `string` and increments the count in the `result` dictionary accordingly.
