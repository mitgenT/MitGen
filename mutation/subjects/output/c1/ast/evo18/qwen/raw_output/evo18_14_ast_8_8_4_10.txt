Based on the provided docstring, the function `how_many_times` appears to be counting occurrences of substrings in the `string`. To do this, it checks for empty substrings and initializes a dictionary with counts. Then, it iterates through the substrings, searching for each one using a while loop and updating the start index if a match is found.

Here's how the code with `<MASK>` filled in would look like:

```python
def how_many_times(string: str, substrings: list) -> dict:
    if any(sub == '' for sub in substrings):
        return "Substrings cannot be empty"
    result = {sub: 0 for sub in substrings}
    for sub in substrings:
        start = 0
        while start < len(string) - 1:
            if string[start:start+len(sub)] == sub:  # Check if the substring matches
                pos = string.find(sub, start)  # Find the next occurrence
                if pos != -1:
                    result[sub] += 1
                    start = pos + 1
                else:
                    break
            else:
                start += 1  # Increment start if no match, continue the search
    return result
```

Now, the `if string[start:start+len(sub)] == sub:` line checks for a match, and `pos = string.find(sub, start)` finds the next position of the substring if a match is found. The `start += 1` line increments the start index if there's no match.
