Based on the provided docstring, we need to initialize the dictionary with zeros for each substring in the list and then iterate through the string to find occurrences of each substring. Here's how to fill in the `<MASK>`:

```python
def how_many_times(string: str, substrings: list) -> dict:
    # Initialize the dictionary with zeros for each substring
    result = {sub: 0 for sub in substrings}
    
    # Continue with the rest of the code
    for sub in substrings:
        start = 0
        while start < len(string) - 1:
            pos = string.find(sub, start)
            if pos != -1:
                result[sub] += 1
                start = pos + 1
            else:
                break
    return result
```
