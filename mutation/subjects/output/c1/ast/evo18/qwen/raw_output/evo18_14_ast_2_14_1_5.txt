Here's the filled-in code based on the provided docstring:

```python
def how_many_times(string: str, substrings: list) -> dict:
    # Check for empty substrings
    for substring in substrings:
        if not substring:
            return "Substrings cannot be empty"
    
    # Handle empty input string case
    if not string:
        return {substring: 0 for substring in substrings}

    # Initialize an empty dictionary to store counts
    substring_counts = {substring: 0 for substring in substrings}

    # Iterate over the input string
    for i in range(len(string)):
        # Check for overlapping occurrences of each substring
        for substring in substrings:
            index = string.find(substring, i)
            if index != -1:  # Found a match
                substring_counts[substring] += 1
                i = index  # Skip the already counted part
            else:  # No more matches from this starting position
                break
    
    return substring_counts
```

Now, the given code has been completed according to the instructions and the example provided.
