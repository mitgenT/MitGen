Based on the provided docstring, the code should check if the input string is empty and handle that case. It should also initialize a dictionary to store the counts, and then iterate through the substrings to find and count them. Here's the infilled code:

```python
def how_many_times(string: str, substrings: list) -> dict:
    if any(sub == '' for sub in substrings):
        return "Substrings cannot be empty"
    
    # Initialize a dictionary to store counts
    result = {sub: 0 for sub in substrings}
    
    # Check if the input string is empty
    if not string:
        for sub in result:
            result[sub] = 0
    else:
        start = 0
        while start < len(string) - 1:
            for sub in substrings:
                pos = string.find(sub, start)
                if pos != -1:
                    result[sub] += 1
                    start = pos + 1
                else:
                    break
    
    return result
```
