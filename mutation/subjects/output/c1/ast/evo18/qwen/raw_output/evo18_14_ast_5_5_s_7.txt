Based on the given docstring, we need to implement a loop that iterates through the `string` using a sliding window approach to check for each substring in the `substrings` list. Here's how the `<MASK>` part should be filled:

```python
    for sub in substrings:
        start = 0
```

The complete code would be:

```python
def how_many_times(string: str, substrings: list) -> dict:
    if any(sub == '' for sub in substrings):
        return "Substrings cannot be empty"
    result = {sub: 0 for sub in substrings}
    if string:
        for sub in substrings:
            start = 0
            while start < len(string) - 1:
                pos = string.find(sub, start)
                if pos != -1:
                    result[sub] += 1
                    start = pos + 1
                else:
                    break
    return result
```
