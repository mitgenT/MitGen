Based on the provided docstring, we need to initialize the dictionary with zero counts for each substring and handle the case where substrings are empty. Here's how to fill in `<MASK>`:

```python
def how_many_times(string: str, substrings: list) -> dict:
    # Initialize dictionary with zero counts for each substring
    result = {sub: 0 for sub in substrings}
    
    # Check if any substring is empty and handle the case
    if any(sub == '' for sub in substrings):
        return "Substrings cannot be empty"
    
    # Continue with the search for substrings in the string
    for sub in substrings:
        start = 0
        while start < len(string) - 1:
            pos = string.find(sub, start)
            if pos != -1:
                result[sub] += 1
                start = pos + 1
            else:
                break
    return result
```
