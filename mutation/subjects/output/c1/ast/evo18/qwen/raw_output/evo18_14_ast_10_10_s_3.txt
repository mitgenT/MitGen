Here's the infilled code:

```python
def how_many_times(string: str, substrings: list) -> dict:
    if any(sub == '' for sub in substrings):
        return "Substrings cannot be empty"
    result = {sub: 0 for sub in substrings}
    for sub in substrings:
        start = 0
        while start < len(string) - len(sub):  # Adjust the condition to avoid index out of range
            pos = string.find(sub, start)
            if pos != -1:
                result[sub] += 1
                start = pos + 1
            else:
                break
    return result
```

Explanation:
- I replaced `<MASK>` with `result[sub] += 1` to increment the count for each occurrence of the substring.
- I also adjusted the `while` loop condition from `start < len(string) - 1` to `start < len(string) - len(sub)` to prevent going out of bounds when looking for overlapping occurrences.
