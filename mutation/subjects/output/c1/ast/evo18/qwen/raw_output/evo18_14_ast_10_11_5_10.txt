Based on the given docstring, the `how_many_times` function should find the occurrences of each substring and update the count in the `result` dictionary. Here's how you can fill in the `<MASK>` parts in the code:

```python
def how_many_times(string: str, substrings: list) -> dict:
    if any(sub == '' for sub in substrings):
        return "Substrings cannot be empty"
    result = {sub: 0 for sub in substrings}
    for sub in substrings:
        start = 0
        while start < len(string) - len(sub):  # Adjust the condition to avoid index out of range
            pos = string.find(sub, start)
            if pos != -1:
                result[sub] += 1
                start = pos + 1  # Move the start position after the found substring
            else:
                break
    return result
```

Now, the code correctly increments the count for each occurrence of a substring and handles the overlapping cases.
