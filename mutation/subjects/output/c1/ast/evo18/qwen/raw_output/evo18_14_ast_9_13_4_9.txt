Based on the provided docstring, we need to update the code to count overlapping occurrences of substrings in the original string. Here's the infilled code:

```python
def how_many_times(string: str, substrings: list) -> dict:
    if any(sub == '' for sub in substrings):
        return "Substrings cannot be empty"
    result = {sub: 0 for sub in substrings}
    for sub in substrings:
        start = 0
        while start < len(string) - len(sub) + 1:  # Adjust the end condition to avoid going out of bounds
            pos = string.find(sub, start)
            if pos != -1:  # A match was found
                result[sub] += 1
                start = pos + 1  # Move the start index after the found occurrence
            else:
                break  # No more matches found, stop the loop
    return result
```

Now the code correctly counts overlapping occurrences of substrings in the `string`.
