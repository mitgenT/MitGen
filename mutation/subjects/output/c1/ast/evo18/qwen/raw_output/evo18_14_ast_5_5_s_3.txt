Based on the given docstring, we need to iterate over the string and find the occurrences of each substring while handling overlapping cases. Here's how the code should be infilled:

```python
def how_many_times(string: str, substrings: list) -> dict:
    if any(sub == '' for sub in substrings):
        return "Substrings cannot be empty"
    result = {sub: 0 for sub in substrings}
    if string:  # Check if the string is not empty
        for sub in substrings:
            start = 0
            while start < len(string) - len(sub) + 1:  # Adjust the loop condition for overlapping cases
                pos = string.find(sub, start)
                if pos != -1:
                    result[sub] += 1
                    start = pos + 1
                else:
                    break
    return result
```
