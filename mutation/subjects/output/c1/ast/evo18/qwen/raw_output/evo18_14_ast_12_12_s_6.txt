Based on the given docstring, the code needs to count overlapping occurrences of the substrings in the original string. Here's the infilled code:

```python
def how_many_times(string: str, substrings: list) -> dict:
    if any(sub == '' for sub in substrings):
        return "Substrings cannot be empty"
    result = {sub: 0 for sub in substrings}
    for sub in substrings:
        start = 0
        while start < len(string) - 1:
            pos = string.find(sub, start)
            if pos != -1:
                result[sub] += 1
                start = pos + 1
            # If we have reached the end of the string or the current substring is not found after the last match,
            # break out of the loop
            if pos == -1 or start >= len(string):
                break
    return result
```
