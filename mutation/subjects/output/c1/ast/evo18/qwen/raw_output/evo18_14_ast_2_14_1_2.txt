Based on the provided docstring, we need to implement a function that counts occurrences of each substring in the original string while handling overlapping cases. Here's the filled-in code:

```python
def how_many_times(string: str, substrings: list) -> dict:
    if not string or any(not sub for sub in substrings):
        if not string:
            return {sub: 0 for sub in substrings}
        else:
            return {"Substrings cannot be empty": 0}

    counts = {}
    for substring in substrings:
        count = 0
        index = 0
        while index < len(string):
            # Check if substring is found at the current index
            if string[index:index+len(substring)] == substring:
                count += 1
                # Update the index by adding length of the substring to account for overlapping cases
                index += len(substring)
            else:
                index += 1
        
        counts[substring] = count
    
    return counts
```

Now the function `how_many_times` has been completed according to the requirements described in the docstring.
