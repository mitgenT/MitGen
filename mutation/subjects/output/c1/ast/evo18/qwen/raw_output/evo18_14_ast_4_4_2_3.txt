Based on the given docstring, the `how_many_times` function needs to check if the input string is empty and handle that case, as well as initialize a dictionary to store the counts if the input is not empty. Here's how to fill in the `<MASK>` parts:

```python
def how_many_times(string: str, substrings: list) -> dict:
    if any(sub == '' for sub in substrings):
        return "Substrings cannot be empty"
    
    # Initialize an empty dictionary to store the counts
    result = {sub: 0 for sub in substrings}

    if string:  # Check if the string is not empty
        for sub in substrings:
            start = 0
            while start < len(string) - 1:
                pos = string.find(sub, start)
                if pos != -1:
                    result[sub] += 1
                    start = pos + 1
                else:
                    break
    return result
```
