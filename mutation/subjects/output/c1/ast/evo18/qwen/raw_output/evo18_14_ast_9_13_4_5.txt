Here's the infilled code:

```python
def how_many_times(string: str, substrings: list) -> dict:
    if any(sub == '' for sub in substrings):
        return "Substrings cannot be empty"
    result = {sub: 0 for sub in substrings}
    for sub in substrings:
        start = 0
        while start < len(string) - len(sub) + 1:  # Adjust the search range to avoid IndexErrors
            pos = string.find(sub, start)
            if pos != -1:  # If the substring is found
                result[sub] += 1
                start = pos + 1  # Move the start position to the next possible match
            else:
                break  # If not found, stop the loop
    return result
```

The changes made include adjusting the `while` loop condition and updating the logic for incrementing the count and moving the start position.
