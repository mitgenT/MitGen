```python
from typing import List, Tuple
def all_prefix_suffix_pairs(string: str, min_length: int) -> List[Tuple[str, str]]:
    n = len(string)
    pairs = []
    for i in range(min_length, n - 1):
        for j in range(i, n + 1 - min_length):
            if string[:i] == string[j-i:j]:
                pairs.append((string[:i], string[j-i:]))
    pairs.sort(key=lambda x: (len(x[0]) + len(x[1]), x))
    return pairs
```

In the given code, <MASK> needs to be replaced with the condition to check for prefix-suffix pairs. In the solution, we iterate through each possible sub-string pair (prefix and suffix) and check if they are equal by comparing the first 'i' characters with the substring from 'j-i' to 'j'. If they are equal, we append the pair to the result list. The pairs are then sorted in increasing order of their lengths and lexicographically if two pairs have equal length.
