## Output
```python
from typing import List, Tuple
def all_prefix_suffix_pairs(string: str, min_length: int) -> List[Tuple[str, str]]:
    n = len(string)
    pairs = []
    for i in range(min_length, n - 1):
        for j in range(i, n + 1 - min_length):
            if i + min_length - 1 < j:
                pairs.append((string[:i], string[j:]))
    pairs.sort(key=lambda x: (len(x[0]) + len(x[1]), x))
    return pairs
```

In the solution, I have added an if condition inside the inner loop, ensuring that the prefix and suffix do not overlap in any characters, and both have a length of at least'min_length'. The pairs are then sorted based on the provided lambda function.
