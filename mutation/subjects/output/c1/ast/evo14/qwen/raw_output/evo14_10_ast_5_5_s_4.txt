Based on the provided docstring, we need to iterate through the string to find all non-overlapping prefix and suffix pairs that are at least `min_length` characters long. Here's how you can fill in the `<MASK>` parts of the code:

```python
from typing import List, Tuple
def all_prefix_suffix_pairs(string: str, min_length: int) -> List[Tuple[str, str]]:
    n = len(string)
    pairs = []
    if min_length <= n:  # Check if the minimum length is valid
        for i in range(min_length, n):  # Start iterating from min_length
            for j in range(i, n + 1 - min_length):  # Iterate until the end of the string with a min_length gap
                if len(set(string[:i]).intersection(set(string[j:]))) == 0:
                    pairs.append((string[:i], string[j:]))
    pairs.sort(key=lambda x: (len(x[0]) + len(x[1]), x))
    return pairs
```

Now the function checks if `min_length` is less than or equal to the length of the string, then finds and appends the non-overlapping prefix-suffix pairs to the `pairs` list according to the criteria provided in the docstring. The `sort` call ensures the correct ordering of the pairs.
