Based on the given docstring, we want to append tuples containing non-overlapping prefix and suffix to the `pairs` list. Here's how you can fill in the `<MASK>` part of the code:

```python
            if j + min_length <= n and i + min_length <= n and string[i:i+min_length] != string[j:j+min_length]:
                pairs.append((string[:i], string[j:]))
```

This condition checks if both the prefix and suffix are valid and don't overlap, then appends them as a tuple. The completed function looks like this:

```python
from typing import List, Tuple
def all_prefix_suffix_pairs(string: str, min_length: int) -> List[Tuple[str, str]]:
    n = len(string)
    pairs = []
    for i in range(min_length, n - 1):
        for j in range(i, n + 1 - min_length):
            if j + min_length <= n and i + min_length <= n and string[i:i+min_length] != string[j:j+min_length]:
                pairs.append((string[:i], string[j:]))
    pairs.sort(key=lambda x: (len(x[0]) + len(x[1]), x))
    return pairs
```
