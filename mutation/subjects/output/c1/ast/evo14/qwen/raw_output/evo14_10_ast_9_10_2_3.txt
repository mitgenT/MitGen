Based on the provided docstring and example, we need to sort the `pairs` list first by length and then lexicographically. Here's how to fill in the `<MASK>` parts:

```python
from typing import List, Tuple
def all_prefix_suffix_pairs(string: str, min_length: int) -> List[Tuple[str, str]]:
    n = len(string)
    pairs = []
    for i in range(min_length, n - 1):
        for j in range(i, n + 1 - min_length):
            if len(set(string[:i]).intersection(set(string[j:]))) == 0:
                pairs.append((string[:i], string[j:]))

    # Sort the pairs based on length and lexicographically
    pairs.sort(key=lambda x: (len(x[0]) + len(x[1]), x[0]))

    # Since the docstring asks for non-overlapping pairs, reverse the pairs after sorting
    pairs.reverse()
    
    return pairs
```

Now, the `<MASK>` sections have been replaced with the sorting logic. The function will return the list of prefix-suffix pairs as requested in the docstring.
