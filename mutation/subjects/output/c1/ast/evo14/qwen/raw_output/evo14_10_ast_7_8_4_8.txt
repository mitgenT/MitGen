Based on the given docstring, we need to store a tuple containing the prefix and suffix in each iteration of the loop. Since the prefix is from `i` to `j` and the suffix is from `j+1` to the end, we can extract them and append them to the `pairs` list.

Here's how to fill in `<MASK>`:

```python
            pairs.append((string[:j+1], string[j+1:]))
```

The complete code with the infilled `<MASK>` is:

```python
from typing import List, Tuple
def all_prefix_suffix_pairs(string: str, min_length: int) -> List[Tuple[str, str]]:
    n = len(string)
    pairs = []
    for i in range(min_length, n - 1):
        for j in range(i, n + 1 - min_length):
            pairs.append((string[:j+1], string[j+1:]))
    pairs.sort(key=lambda x: (len(x[0]) + len(x[1]), x))
    return pairs
```
