Based on the given docstring, we need to sort the `pairs` list in increasing order of their lengths and lexicographically if lengths are equal. We can use a sorting function like `sorted()` with a custom key to achieve this. Here's how you can infill the <MASK> in the given code:

```python
from typing import List, Tuple
def all_prefix_suffix_pairs(string: str, min_length: int) -> List[Tuple[str, str]]:
    n = len(string)
    pairs = []
    for i in range(min_length, n - 1):
        for j in range(i, n + 1 - min_length):
            if len(set(string[:i]).intersection(set(string[j:]))) == 0:
                pairs.append((string[:i], string[j:]))

    # Sort the pairs list based on length and lexicographic order
    pairs.sort(key=lambda x: (len(x[0]), x[0]))

    # If there are multiple pairs with the same length, sort them lexicographically
    pairs.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])

    return pairs
```

Now, the `<MASK>` sections have been replaced with the appropriate sorting logic.
