Based on the given docstring, we need to sort the `pairs` list before returning it. Since the pairs should be sorted in increasing order of their lengths and lexicographically if lengths are equal, we can use the `sorted` function with a custom key function that returns a tuple of length and the string itself for lexicographic comparison.

Here's the code with `<MASK>` filled in:

```python
from typing import List, Tuple
def all_prefix_suffix_pairs(string: str, min_length: int) -> List[Tuple[str, str]]:
    n = len(string)
    pairs = []
    for i in range(min_length, n - 1):
        for j in range(i, n + 1 - min_length):
            if len(set(string[:i]).intersection(set(string[j:]))) == 0:
                pairs.append((string[:i], string[j:]))
    # Sort the pairs based on length and lexicographically
    pairs = sorted(pairs, key=lambda x: (len(x[0]), x[0] + x[1]))
    return pairs
```
