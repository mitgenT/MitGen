Here's how you can fill in the `<MASK>` in the given code:

```python
from typing import List, Tuple
def all_prefix_suffix_pairs(string: str, min_length: int) -> List[Tuple[str, str]]:
    n = len(string)
    pairs = []
    if n >= min_length * 2:  # Check if there's enough characters to find pairs
        for i in range(min_length, n - min_length):  # Start from min_length to avoid overlapping
            if len(set(string[:i]).intersection(set(string[i+min_length:]))) == 0:
                pairs.append((string[:i], string[i+min_length:]))
    pairs.sort(key=lambda x: (len(x[0]) + len(x[1]), x))
    return pairs
```

Now, the function `all_prefix_suffix_pairs` checks if the input string has enough characters, then finds non-overlapping prefix-suffix pairs with the specified minimum length, and sorts them as required.
