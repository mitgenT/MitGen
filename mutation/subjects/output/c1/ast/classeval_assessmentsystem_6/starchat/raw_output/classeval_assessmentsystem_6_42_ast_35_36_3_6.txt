The given code is a part of a larger class `AssessmentSystem`, which includes methods like `add_student`, `add_course_score`, `get_gpa`, `get_all_students_with_fail_course`, `get_course_average`, and `get_top_student`.

In the method `get_top_student()`, the <MASK> was meant to calculate the maximum GPA among all the students. To do this, I have defined two variables: `top_gpa` and `top_student`. The `top_gpa` initially has a value of 0 and `top_student` is an empty string. Then, in the loop, we calculate the GPA for each student using the `get_gpa()` method. If the calculated GPA is greater than `top_gpa`, we update `top_gpa` and `top_student` accordingly. Finally, `top_student` will have the name of the student with the highest GPA.

Here is the completed code:

```python
class AssessmentSystem:
    def __init__(self):
        self.students = {}

    def add_student(self, name, grade, major):
        self.students[name] = {'name': name, 'grade': grade,'major': major, 'courses': {}}

    def add_course_score(self, name, course, score):
        if name in self.students:
            self.students[name]['courses'][course] = score

    def get_gpa(self, name):
        return sum(self.students[name]['courses'].values()) / len(self.students[name]['courses'])

    def get_all_students_with_fail_course(self):
        students = []
        for name, student in self.students.items():
            for course, score in student['courses'].items():
                if score < 60:
                    students.append(name)
                    break
        return students

    def get_course_average(self, course):
        total = 0
        count = 0
        for student in self.students.values():
            if course in student['courses']:
                score = student['courses'][course]
                if score is not None:
                    total += score
                    count += 1
        return total / count if count > 0 else None

    def get_top_student(self):
        top_gpa = 0
        top_student = ""
        for name, student in self.students.items():
            gpa = self.get_gpa(name)
            if gpa is not None and gpa > top_gpa:
                top_gpa = gpa
                top_student = name
        return top_student
```

Now, you can create an object of `AssessmentSystem` and use the implemented methods to perform various operations related to student assessment.
