## Infilled code:

```python
class AssessmentSystem:
    def __init__(self):
        self.students = {}

    def add_student(self, name, grade, major):
        self.students[name] = {'name': name, 'grade': grade,'major': major, 'courses': {}}

    def add_course_score(self, name, course, score):
        if name in self.students:
            self.students[name]['courses'][course] = score

    def get_gpa(self, name):
        return sum(self.students[name]['courses'].values()) / len(self.students[name]['courses']) if self.students[name]['courses'] else None

    def get_all_students_with_fail_course(self):
        students = []
        for name, student in self.students.items():
            for course, score in student['courses'].items():
                if score < 60:
                    students.append(name)
                    break
        return students

    def get_course_average(self, course):
        total = 0
        count = 0
        for student in self.students.values():
            if course in student['courses']:
                score = student['courses'][course]
                if score is not None:
                    total += score
                    count += 1
        return total / count if count > 0 else None

    def get_top_student(self):
        top_student = None
        top_gpa = 0
        for name, student in self.students.items():
            gpa = self.get_gpa(name)
            if gpa is not None and gpa > top_gpa:
                top_gpa = gpa
                top_student = name
        return top_student
```

In the code above, I've infilled `<MASK>` in `get_all_students_with_fail_course` method by defining and initialising the `students` list. The 'if' condition to calculate GPA has been modified to check if the student has any course scores. Also, the top student's GPA calculation now uses the `get_gpa()` method to prevent division by zero in the scenario of no courses.
