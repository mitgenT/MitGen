Infill `<MASK>` of the `get_all_students_with_fail_course` function as follows:

```python
def get_all_students_with_fail_course(self):
    students = []  # Initiate an empty list to store names of students who have failed
    for name, student in self.students.items():
        for course, score in student['courses'].items():
            if score < 60:
                students.append(name)  # Append student name to the list
                break  # Break the inner loop as the student has failed in at least one course
    return students
```

This solution corrects the incomplete loop and ensures that the correct list of students who have at least one failed course is returned.
