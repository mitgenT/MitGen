In the given code, the placeholder <MASK> is needed to be filled in the add_course_score method in the AssessmentSystem class. 

The filled-in <MASK> should add the given course and score to the specified student in the 'courses' dictionary. We also need to handle the situation when the student or the course does not exist.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
class AssessmentSystem:
    def __init__(self):
        self.students = {}

    def add_student(self, name, grade, major):
        self.students[name] = {'name': name, 'grade': grade,'major': major, 'courses': {}}

    def add_course_score(self, name, course, score):
        if name in self.students:
            student = self.students[name]
            if course not in student['courses']:
                student['courses'][course] = score
            else:
                print(f"The student {name} already took the course {course}.")
        else:
            print(f"No student found with the name {name}.")

    # Other methods remain unchanged...
```

With this correction, the AssessmentSystem class now can handle course score adding operations effectively. If a student or a course does not exist, it will print a suitable message. If a student has already taken the course, it will also print a message.
```python
class AssessmentSystem:
    def __init__(self):
        self.students = {}

    def add_student(self, name, grade, major):
        self.students[name] = {'name': name, 'grade': grade,'major': major, 'courses': {}}

    def add_course_score(self, name, course, score):
        if name in self.students:
            student = self.students[name]
            if course not in student['courses']:
                student['courses'][course] = score
            else:
                print(f'The student {name} already took the course {course}.')
        else:
            print(f'No student found with the name {name}.')

                if score < 60:
                    students.append(name)
                    break
        return students

        count = 0
        for student in self.students.values():
            if course in student['courses']:
                score = student['courses'][course]
                if score is not None:
                    total += score
                    count += 1
        return total / count if count > 0 else None

                top_gpa = gpa
                top_student = name
        return top_student
