In the output code, I have completed all the <MASK> parts to make the given code functionally correct and complete the implementation of the `AssessmentSystem` class as described in the given docstring. The provided functions `add_student`, `add_course_score`, `get_gpa`, `get_all_students_with_fail_course`, `get_course_average`, and `get_top_student` operate as intended. The average GPA method is updated to return `None` if there are no courses for a student, and a check is added in the `get_all_students_with_fail_course` method to append a student to the `students` list only if the student has a score less than 60 in any course.
