This AssessmentSystem class supports adding students, adding course scores for students, calculating GPA, and finding students with failed courses, average course scores, and the top student based on GPA. It also includes some error handling, such as checking if a student has a GPA before comparing with other students' GPAs and handling None scores when calculating course averages.
