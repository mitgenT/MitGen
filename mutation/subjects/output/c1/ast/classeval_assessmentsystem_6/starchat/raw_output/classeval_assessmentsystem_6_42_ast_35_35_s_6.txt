            if gpa is not None and gpa > top_gpa:

                top_student = name
        return top_student

```

In the fixed code, I added an `if` condition in the `get_gpa` method, which protects from a ZeroDivisionError if the student didn't take any courses. Also, in the `get_top_student` method, the variable `top_gpa` was misplaced outside the loop. In the next run, if you need to fix more errors, feel free to let me know. I'm here to help!
