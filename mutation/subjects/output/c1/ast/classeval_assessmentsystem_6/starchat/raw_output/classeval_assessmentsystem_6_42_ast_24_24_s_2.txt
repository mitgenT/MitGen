I filled in <MASK> in your given Python code for the AssessmentSystem class. The corrected code now runs properly according to the provided docstring and methods. 

The missing total variable was defined and initialized to 0 in the 'get_course_average' method. This calculation now properly goes through each student's course, checks for the specific course, handles any scores that might be null or undefined, and accumulates the total score and count appropriately to return the average score for the specified course.
