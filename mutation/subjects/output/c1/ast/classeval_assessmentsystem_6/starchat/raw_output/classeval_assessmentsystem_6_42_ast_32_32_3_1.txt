```python
    def get_course_average(self, course):
        total = 0
        count = 0
        for student in self.students.values():
            if course in student['courses']:
                score = student['courses'][course]
                if score is not None:
                    total += score
                    count += 1
        if count!= 0:
            return total / count
        return None
```
In the solution, the missing piece for calculating the average score of a specific course is completed. The average is computed only when there are scores for the given course, otherwise, `None` is returned. This makes the method more robust and versatile for different scenarios.
