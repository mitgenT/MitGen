```python
    def get_all_students_with_fail_course(self):
        students = []
        for name, student in self.students.items():
            for course, score in student['courses'].items():
                if score < 60:
                    students.append(name)
                    break  # Add this line to avoid duplicate names in the list
        return students
```

In the provided solution, I added 'break' statement inside the inner for loop under the 'get_all_students_with_fail_course' method. This adjustment ensures that when a student has already been found to have failed a course, their name is not added again to the list of students failing a course. The 'break' statement causes the loop to terminate immediately and jump to the next iteration of the outer loop, ensuring that only unique student names appear in the resulting list.
