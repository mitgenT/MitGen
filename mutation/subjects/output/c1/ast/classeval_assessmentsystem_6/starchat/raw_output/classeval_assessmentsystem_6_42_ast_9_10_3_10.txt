In this code, I first ensured that the student exists in the `self.students` dictionary before adding a course score. I did this by using the `if name in self.students:` condition before `self.students[name]['courses'][course] = score`. This ensures that no `KeyError` will be raised if the student name does not exist. Then, I modified `get_gpa(self, name)` to use the total and count of scores directly instead of using the list of values. This reduces the need for multiple dictionary lookups in the loop. For calculating the average score of a course, I added an additional `if score is not None:` condition to exclude `None` values from the calculation. Finally, I used the `get_gpa` method to calculate the GPAs for all students and found the top student based on the highest GPA.
