Infill <MASK> of the given code by modifying the get_all_students_with_fail_course method:

```python
def get_all_students_with_fail_course(self):
    students = []
    for name, student in self.students.items():
        for course, score in student['courses'].items():
            if score < 60:
                students.append(name)
                break
    return list(set(students))  # convert list to set to remove duplicates and then back to list
```

This change ensures that if a student fails a course, their name will only appear once in the returned list.
