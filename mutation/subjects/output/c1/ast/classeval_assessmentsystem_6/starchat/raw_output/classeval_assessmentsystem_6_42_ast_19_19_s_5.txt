        for name, student in self.students.items():
            gpa = self.get_gpa(name)
            if gpa is not None and gpa > top_gpa:

```
In the `get_all_students_with_fail_course` function, `students.append(name)` was added before the break statement, to avoid skipping a student who has multiple failing courses but still needs to be added to the result.
This modification ensures that every student who failed at least one course is included in the final result.
