## Modified code:

```python
class AssessmentSystem:
    def __init__(self):
        self.students = {}

    def add_student(self, name, grade, major):
        self.students[name] = {'name': name, 'grade': grade,'major': major, 'courses': {}}

    def add_course_score(self, name, course, score):
        if name in self.students:
            self.students[name]['courses'][course] = score

    def get_gpa(self, name):
        if name in self.students:
            scores = self.students[name]['courses'].values()
            return sum(scores) / len(scores) if scores else None

    def get_all_students_with_fail_course(self):
        students = []
        for name, student in self.students.items():
            if any(score < 60 for score in student['courses'].values()):
                students.append(name)
        return students

    def get_course_average(self, course):
        total = 0
        count = 0
        for student in self.students.values():
            if course in student['courses']:
                score = student['courses'][course]
                if score is not None:
                    total += score
                    count += 1
        return total / count if count > 0 else None

    def get_top_student(self):
        top_student = None
        top_gpa = 0
        for name, student in self.students.items():
            gpa = self.get_gpa(name)
            if gpa is not None and gpa > top_gpa:
                top_gpa = gpa
                top_student = name
        return top_student
```

Here I have fixed and modified several parts of the provided code:

1. In the `get_gpa` method, I added a check if the student is in the `students` dictionary to avoid a KeyError.
2. In the `get_all_students_with_fail_course` method, I used the `any` function to check if any score in the student's courses dictionary is less than 60, and if so, added the student's name to the `students` list.
3. Added `if name in self.students` checks in `get_gpa` and `add_course_score` methods. This ensures that the operations are only performed if the student exists in the system.
4. In the `get_course_average` method, I made sure to calculate the average only if the student has taken the given course and the score for that course is not None.
5. Added a `return None` statement in the `get_course_average` method when the count is 0, to avoid division by zero. This is a common practice in such cases.
6. In the `get_top_student` method, I added a `if gpa is not None` condition to check if a student has any course scores before comparing with the current top student's GPA. This avoids a potential division by zero error when calling the `get_gpa` method.
