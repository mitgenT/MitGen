```python
class AssessmentSystem:
    def __init__(self):
        self.students = {}

    def add_student(self, name, grade, major):
        self.students[name] = {'name': name, 'grade': grade,'major': major, 'courses': {}}

    def add_course_score(self, name, course, score):
        if name in self.students:
            self.students[name]['courses'][course] = score

    def get_gpa(self, name):
        scores = [score for score in self.students[name]['courses'].values() if score is not None]
        return sum(scores) / len(scores) if scores else None

    def get_all_students_with_fail_course(self):
        students = []
        for name, student in self.students.items():
            for course, score in student['courses'].items():
                if score < 60:
                    students.append(name)
                    break
        return students

    def get_course_average(self, course):
        total = 0
        count = 0
        for student in self.students.values():
            if course in student['courses']:
                score = student['courses'][course]
                if score is not None:
                    total += score
                    count += 1
        return total / count if count > 0 else None

    def get_top_student(self):
        top_student = None
        top_gpa = 0
        for name, student in self.students.items():
            gpa = self.get_gpa(name)
            if gpa is not None and gpa > top_gpa:
                top_student = name
                top_gpa = gpa
        return top_student

```
In this solution, the `get_gpa()` method is updated to filter out `None` values before calculating the average, and the `get_top_student()` method is updated to find the student with the highest GPA iteratively. The final code ensures that the Assessment System class functions as expected, providing the necessary functionality to add students, add course scores, calculate GPA, and other requested features.
