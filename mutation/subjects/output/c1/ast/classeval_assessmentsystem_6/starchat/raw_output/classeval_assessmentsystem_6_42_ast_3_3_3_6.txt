## Fixed Output

    def __init__(self):
        self.students = {}

    def add_student(self, name, grade, major):
        self.students[name] = {'name': name, 'grade': grade,'major': major, 'courses': {}}

    def get_gpa(self, name):
        if name in self.students:
            course_scores = self.students[name]['courses'].values()
            return sum(course_scores) / len(course_scores) if course_scores else None

                if score < 60:
                    students.append(name)

                    total += score

```

The fixes to the code are:

1. Created an empty dictionary named `self.students` inside the `__init__` method of the `AssessmentSystem` class.

2. Added a check for whether a student with the given name exists in the `self.students` dictionary before adding a course score in the `add_course_score` method.

3. In the `get_gpa` method, calculated the GPA by summing the scores of all courses and dividing by the total number of courses for a student. Also, added a check for the existence of course scores before performing the division.

4. In the `get_all_students_with_fail_course` method, used `break` to exit the inner loop as soon as a student with a failing score is found in a course.

5. In the `get_course_average` method, added a check for the existence of course scores and for scores being `None` before adding them to the `total` and incrementing `count`.

6. In the `get_top_student` method, added a check for whether the GPA of a student is `None` before comparing it with `top_gpa`.
