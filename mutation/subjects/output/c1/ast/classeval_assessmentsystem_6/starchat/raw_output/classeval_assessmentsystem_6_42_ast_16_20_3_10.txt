The get_gpa method is modified to return 0 if a student does not have any courses. This is to ensure the method always returns a valid numerical GPA.

The get_all_students_with_fail_course method uses the 'any' function and a generator expression to check if a student has any score below 60. It appends the name of such students to the'students' list and returns it.

The get_course_average method remains unchanged. The same approach as before is used to calculate the average score for a specific course by iterating over all students and their respective course scores. The method returns None if no student has a score for the given course.

The get_top_student method remains unchanged as it already calculates the GPA of each student using the 'get_gpa' method and identifies the student with the highest GPA.
