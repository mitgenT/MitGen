The method `get_gpa(name)` calculates the average grade of a student.

Test the code:

```python
system = AssessmentSystem()
system.add_student('student 1', 3, 'SE')
system.add_course_score('student 1','math', 94)
system.add_course_score('student 1', 'Computer Network', 92)
system.add_course_score('student 1', 'Society', 59)
print(system.get_all_students_with_fail_course()) # ['student 1']
print(system.get_course_average('math')) # 94.0
print(system.get_gpa('student 1')) # 86.0
system.add_student('student 2', 2, 'SE')
system.add_course_score('student 2', 'Computer Network', 97)
print(system.get_top_student()) #'student 2'
