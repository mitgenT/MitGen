In the given code:

```python
def get_all_students_with_fail_course(self):
    students = []
    for name, student in self.students.items():
        for course, score in student['courses'].items():
            if score < 60:
                students.append(name)
    return students
```

Infill `<MASK>` with `students.append(name)`. This will collect the names of students who have any score below 60.
