```python
def get_course_average(self, course):
    total = 0
    count = 0
    for student in self.students.values():
        if course in student['courses']:
            score = student['courses'][course]
            if score is not None:
                total += score
                count += 1
    return total / count if count > 0 else None
```
The `get_course_average` function calculates and returns the average score of a specific course across all students who have taken the course. If no one has a record for the course, the function returns None.
