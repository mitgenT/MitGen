```python
    def get_top_student(self):
        top_gpa = 0
        top_student = None
        for name, student in self.students.items():
            gpa = self.get_gpa(name)
            if gpa is not None and gpa > top_gpa:
                top_gpa = gpa
                top_student = name
        return top_student
```
The completed program will calculate the GPA for every student using the 'get_gpa' method, and return the student name with the highest GPA. The 'get_top_student' method iterates over all students and maintains the student with the highest GPA thus far. This implementation ensures that it calculates the GPA only once for each student, improving performance when handling large sets of students.
