```
In the provided solution, `<MASK>` in the `get_all_students_with_fail_course` function is replaced with `students.append(name)`. This adds the student name to the `students` list only once if a student has failed any course (i.e., when `score < 60` is met). This prevents duplicate student names from being added to the list.
