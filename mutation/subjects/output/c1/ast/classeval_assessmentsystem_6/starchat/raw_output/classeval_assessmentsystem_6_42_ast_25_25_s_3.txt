```python
    def get_course_average(self, course):
        total = 0
        count = 0
        for student in self.students.values():
            if course in student['courses']:
                score = student['courses'][course]
                if score is not None:
                    total += score
                    count += 1
        return total / count if count > 0 else None
```
I have completed the `get_course_average` function as per the provided code. It computes the average score for a specific course by summing all the scores for that course and dividing by the number of students who took that course. It also handles cases where a student might not have scores for the course.
