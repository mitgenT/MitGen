```python

        self.students = {}

    def add_student(self, name, grade, major):
        self.students[name] = {'name': name, 'grade': grade,'major': major, 'courses': {}}

            for score in self.students[name]['courses'].values():
                if score is not None:
                    total += score
                    count += 1
            return total / count if count > 0 else None
        return None

    def get_all_students_with_fail_course(self):
        students = []
        for name, student in self.students.items():
            for course, score in student['courses'].items():
                if score < 60:
                    students.append(name)
                    break

        for student in self.students.values():
            if course in student['courses']:
                score = student['courses'][course]
                if score is not None:
                    total += score

    def get_top_student(self):
        top_student = None
        top_gpa = 0
        for name, student in self.students.items():
            gpa = self.get_gpa(name)
            if gpa is not None and gpa > top_gpa:

        return top_student
```
In the provided solution, I completed the missing parts of the `AssessmentSystem` class. The `get_gpa` method now calculates the GPA for the given student, by iterating over the courses and computing the average score. Similarly, the `get_top_student` method uses the `get_gpa` method to find the student with the highest GPA.
