Here is the completed program:

```python
class AssessmentSystem:
    def __init__(self):
        self.students = {}

    def add_student(self, name, grade, major):
        self.students[name] = {'name': name, 'grade': grade,'major': major, 'courses': {}}

    def add_course_score(self, name, course, score):
        if name in self.students:
            self.students[name]['courses'][course] = score

    def get_gpa(self, name):
        if name in self.students and self.students[name]['courses']:
            scores = self.students[name]['courses'].values()
            return sum(scores) / len(scores)
        return None

    def get_all_students_with_fail_course(self):
        students = []
        for name, student in self.students.items():
            for course, score in student['courses'].items():
                if score < 60:
                    students.append(name)
                    break
        return students

    def get_course_average(self, course):
        total = 0
        count = 0
        for student in self.students.values():
            if course in student['courses']:
                score = student['courses'][course]
                if score is not None:
                    total += score
                    count += 1
        return total / count if count > 0 else None

    def get_top_student(self):
        top_student = None
        top_gpa = 0
        for name, student in self.students.items():
            gpa = self.get_gpa(name)
            if gpa is not None and gpa > top_gpa:
                top_gpa = gpa
                top_student = name
        return top_student
```
In this solution, for the `add_course_score` method, it checks if the student's name exists in the students dictionary before adding the course score. If the student does not exist, it simply ignores the request, because the problem description doesn't specify how to handle such cases. For other methods, it adds checks to prevent errors, like when calculating the GPA of a student who does not have any scores or when looking up a course average for a course that no student has taken. The methods return None in such cases to avoid division by zero.
