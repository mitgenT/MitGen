In the updated program, I have added conditional checks in the following areas to ensure correctness:

1. In the get_gpa method, I have added an additional check to prevent a division by zero error when a student has no courses recorded.
   
2. In the get_all_students_with_fail_course method, I used a break statement to avoid unnecessary iterations after finding a student with a failing course.
   
3. In the get_course_average method, I have changed the <MASK> placeholder with code that calculates the average score of a specific course for all students, avoiding division by zero errors when no scores are available for that course.
