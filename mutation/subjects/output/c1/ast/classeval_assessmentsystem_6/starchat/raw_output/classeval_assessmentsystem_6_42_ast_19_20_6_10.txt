```python
    def get_all_students_with_fail_course(self):
        students = []
        for name, student in self.students.items():
            for course, score in student['courses'].items():
                if score < 60:
                    students.append(name)
                    break
        return students
```
This updated code will correctly gather a list of students who have any course score less than 60 and return them as a list. The `break` statement within the inner loop prevents the same student's name from being appended multiple times if they have more than one failing course.
