                if score is not None:
                    total += score
                    count += 1
        return total / count if count > 0 else None

    def get_top_student(self):
        top_student = None
        top_gpa = 0
        for name, student in self.students.items():
            gpa = self.get_gpa(name)
            if gpa is not None and gpa > top_gpa:
                top_gpa = gpa
                top_student = name
        return top_student

```

In the solution, the `<MASK>` in `get_gpa` function is replaced with the appropriate logic to calculate the GPA of a student based on the scores of the courses they have taken. The function calculates the sum of all the scores and divides it by the total number of courses, excluding any scores that are None (indicating that the course score has not been added yet). This solution fulfills the requirements for the student assessment system as described in the docstring.
