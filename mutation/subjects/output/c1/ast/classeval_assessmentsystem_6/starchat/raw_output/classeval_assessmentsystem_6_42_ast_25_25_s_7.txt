I have filled <MASK> to check if the student's course dictionary is not empty before calculating the GPA in `get_gpa` function. If it's empty, it will return `None` to avoid a division by zero error. In the `get_course_average` function, I added a count to properly calculate the average and handle potential cases where there might not be any scores for the given course. The `get_top_student` function has been kept the same, as it relies on the already implemented `get_gpa` method.

The complete program for the student assessment system class is now ready.
