The infilled <MASK> code in the `get_top_student` method added two variables `top_gpa` and `top_student` with initial values. It then iterates through each student and uses the `get_gpa` method to calculate each student's GPA. Finally, it checks if the calculated GPA is higher than the current `top_gpa`, and updates `top_gpa` and `top_student` accordingly. After iterating through all students, it returns the name of the student with the highest GPA.
