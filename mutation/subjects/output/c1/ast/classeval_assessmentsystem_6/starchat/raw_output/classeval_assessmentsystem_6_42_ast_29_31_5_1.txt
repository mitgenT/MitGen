```python
    def get_course_average(self, course):
        total = 0
        count = 0
        for student in self.students.values():
            if course in student['courses']:
                score = student['courses'][course]
                total += score
                count += 1
        return total / count if count > 0 else None
```
Infilling `<MASK>` with `total += score; count += 1` ensures that the total and count are correctly calculated for the provided course's scores in the AssessmentSystem class.
