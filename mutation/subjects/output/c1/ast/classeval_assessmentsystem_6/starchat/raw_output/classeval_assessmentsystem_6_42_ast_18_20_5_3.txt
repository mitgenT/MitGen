```python
def get_all_students_with_fail_course(self):
    students = []
    for name, student in self.students.items():
        for course, score in student['courses'].items():
            if score < 60:
                students.append(name)
                break
    return students
```
The program fills in the missing `get_all_students_with_fail_course` function. It iterates through each student and course, checking if any course score is less than 60. If so, the student's name is appended to the `students` list. This list is returned as the result of the function.
