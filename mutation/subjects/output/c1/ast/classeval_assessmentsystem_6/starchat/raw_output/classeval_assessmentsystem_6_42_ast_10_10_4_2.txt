The infill <MASK> in the given code is `self.students[name]['courses'][course] = score`. This line completes the function of adding a course score to the student's course information in the `self.students` dictionary. The complete code implements a student assessment system with methods such as adding students, adding course scores, calculating GPAs, and finding the student with the highest GPA. It also includes error handling to ensure the integrity and consistency of the data stored in the system.
