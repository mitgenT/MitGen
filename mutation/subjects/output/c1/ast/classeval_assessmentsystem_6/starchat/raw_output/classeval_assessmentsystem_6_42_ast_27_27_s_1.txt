In the code provided, I modified `get_gpa`, `get_course_average` and `get_all_students_with_fail_course` functions to handle conditions where a student might not have any courses or a course might not exist in a student's course dictionary. In these cases, it will now return `None` for `get_gpa` and 0/0 division by zero error in `get_course_average`, and it will simply skip the student and continue with the loop. In the `get_all_students_with_fail_course` function, it will now only add a student to the list of students who have at least one course with a score less than 60.
