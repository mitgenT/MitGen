```python
    def get_course_average(self, course):
        total = 0
        count = 0
        for student in self.students.values():
            if course in student['courses']:
                score = student['courses'][course]
                if score is not None:
                    total += score
                    count += 1
        if count == 0:
            return None
        else:
            return total / count
```

In the solution, for calculating the average score of a specific course in the `get_course_average` method, added a condition to check if `count` is 0 to prevent dividing by zero. Also, added the appropriate return statement when `count` is not 0 to calculate the average.
