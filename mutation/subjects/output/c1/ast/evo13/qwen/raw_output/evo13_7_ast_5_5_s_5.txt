Based on the provided docstring, it seems that we want to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the list elements one by one, starting from the second element. If the GCD is 1 after processing all elements, we should return -1. Here's how you can fill in the `<MASK>` in the given code:

```python
from typing import List
def multiple_greatest_common_divisors(numbers: List[int]) -> int:
    import math
    gcd = numbers[0]
    if len(numbers) > 1:  # Check if there's more than one number
        for num in numbers[1:]:
            gcd = math.gcd(gcd, num)
    if gcd == 1:
        gcd = -1
    return gcd
```
