Here's the code with `<MASK>` filled in based on the given docstring:

```python
from typing import List
def multiple_greatest_common_divisors(numbers: List[int]) -> int:
    import math
    gcd = numbers[0]
    for num in numbers[1:]:
        gcd = math.gcd(gcd, num)
    
    # Check if GCD is 1, return -1 if true
    if gcd == 1:
        return -1
    
    # Otherwise, return the gcd
    else:
        return gcd
```

Now the function should work as described in the docstring.
