Here's how you can fill in the `<MASK>` in the given code:

```python
from typing import List
import math

def multiple_greatest_common_divisors(numbers: List[int]) -> int:
    if len(numbers) == 1:  # Check if there's only one element
        return -1
    else:
        gcd = numbers[0]  # Initialize GCD with the first number
    for num in numbers[1:]:
        gcd = math.gcd(gcd, num)
    return gcd
```

The `if` condition checks if the list has only one element, which is not enough to calculate the GCD. If it's true, we return -1. Otherwise, we initialize the GCD with the first number and iterate through the rest of the list, updating the GCD at each step using `math.gcd`.
