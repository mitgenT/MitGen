Based on the provided docstring, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all the numbers in the list. If the GCD is 1, we should return -1. Here's how to fill in the `<MASK>` parts:

```python
from typing import List
import math

def multiple_greatest_common_divisors(numbers: List[int]) -> int:
    gcd = numbers[0]
    if len(numbers) > 1:  # Check if there are more than one number
        for num in numbers[1:]:  # Iterate over the rest of the numbers
            gcd = math.gcd(gcd, num)
    else:  # If it's only one number, or GCD is already found with len(numbers) == 1
        if gcd == 1:
            gcd = -1
    return gcd
```
