Based on the provided docstring, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all elements in the list. If the GCD is 1, we should return -1. Here's how to fill in the <MASK> in the code:

```python
from typing import List
import math

def multiple_greatest_common_divisors(numbers: List[int]) -> int:
    gcd = numbers[0]
    if len(numbers) > 1:  # Check if there's more than one number
        for num in numbers[1:]:
            gcd = math.gcd(gcd, num)
    if gcd == 1:
        gcd = -1
    return gcd
```
