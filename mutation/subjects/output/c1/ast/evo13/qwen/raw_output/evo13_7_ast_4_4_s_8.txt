Based on the provided docstring, it seems like we want to check if the length of the list `numbers` is 2 before proceeding with finding the greatest common divisor (GCD). If the length is 2 and their GCD is 1, we should return -1. Here's how to fill in the `<MASK>`:

```python
from typing import List
def multiple_greatest_common_divisors(numbers: List[int]) -> int:
    import math
    if len(numbers) == 2 and math.gcd(numbers[0], numbers[1]) == 1:
        return -1
    gcd = numbers[0]
    for num in numbers[1:]:
        gcd = math.gcd(gcd, num)
    return gcd
```
