Based on the provided docstring, we need to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all the numbers in the list. If the GCD is 1, we should return -1. Here's how to fill in the <MASK>:

```python
from typing import List
def multiple_greatest_common_divisors(numbers: List[int]) -> int:
    import math
    gcd = numbers[0]
    if len(numbers) > 1:  # Check if there are more than one number
        for num in numbers[1:]:
            gcd = math.gcd(gcd, num)
        if gcd == 1:
            gcd = -1
    return gcd
```
