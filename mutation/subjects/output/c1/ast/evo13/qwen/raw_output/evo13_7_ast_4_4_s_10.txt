Based on the given docstring, we need to check if the length of the list `numbers` is less than 3 before proceeding with finding the GCD. If it's less than 3, the GCD is 1, so we should return -1. Otherwise, we proceed with calculating the GCD. Here's how to fill in `<MASK>`:

```python
from typing import List
def multiple_greatest_common_divisors(numbers: List[int]) -> int:
    import math
    if len(numbers) < 3:
        return -1
    gcd = math.gcd(numbers[0], numbers[1])
    for num in numbers[2:]:
        gcd = math.gcd(gcd, num)
    return gcd
```
