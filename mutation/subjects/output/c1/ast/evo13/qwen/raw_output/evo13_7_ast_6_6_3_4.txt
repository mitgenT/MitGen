Based on the provided docstring, we want to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of a list of integers and update `gcd` with the current GCD of `gcd` and `num`. If the GCD is 1, we should break out of the loop and return -1. Here's how to fill in the `<MASK>`:

```python
from typing import List
def multiple_greatest_common_divisors(numbers: List[int]) -> int:
    import math
    gcd = numbers[0]
    for num in numbers[1:]:
        if gcd == 1:  # Check if GCD is 1 before updating
            return -1
        gcd = math.gcd(gcd, num)
    return gcd
```
