Based on the given docstring, we need to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the list elements iteratively, starting with the first element. If the GCD is 1, we should return -1. Here's the infilled code:

```python
from typing import List
def multiple_greatest_common_divisors(numbers: List[int]) -> int:
    import math
    gcd = numbers[0]  # Start with the first number as the initial GCD
    for num in numbers[1:]:
        gcd = math.gcd(gcd, num)
    if gcd == 1:
        return -1
    else:
        return gcd
```
