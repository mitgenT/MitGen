Based on the given docstring, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the list of integers and update `gcd` accordingly. If the GCD is found, we continue with the loop, otherwise, we set `gcd` to `num` since that would mean they have no common divisors other than 1. Here's the filled-in code:

```python
from typing import List
def multiple_greatest_common_divisors(numbers: List[int]) -> int:
    import math
    gcd = numbers[0]
    for num in numbers[1:]:
        if gcd > 1:  # Continue the loop if GCD is greater than 1
            gcd = math.gcd(gcd, num)
        else:  # If GCD is 1, set it to num since they have no common divisors
            gcd = num
    return gcd
```
