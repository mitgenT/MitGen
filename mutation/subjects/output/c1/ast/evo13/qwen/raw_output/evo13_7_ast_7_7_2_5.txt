Based on the provided docstring, we need to check if the GCD is 1, and if it is, return -1. Here's the filled-in code:

```python
from typing import List
import math

def multiple_greatest_common_divisors(numbers: List[int]) -> int:
    gcd = numbers[0]
    for num in numbers[1:]:
        gcd = math.gcd(gcd, num)
    
    # Check if GCD is 1
    if gcd == 1:
        return -1
    else:
        return gcd
```

Now the function `multiple_greatest_common_divisors` calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the input list and returns the result according to the conditions described in the docstring.
