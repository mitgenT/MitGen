Based on the provided docstring, we need to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the list of integers. The GCD is typically found using the math.gcd function. If the GCD is 1, we should return -1. Here's how to fill in the <MASK>:

```python
from typing import List
import math

def multiple_greatest_common_divisors(numbers: List[int]) -> int:
    gcd = numbers[0]
    for num in numbers[1:]:
        gcd = math.gcd(gcd, num)
    if gcd == 1:
        return -1
    else:
        return gcd

```
