Based on the provided docstring, the code should calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all the numbers in the list. When the GCD is 1, it should return -1. So, we need to initialize `gcd` with the first number in the list and then iterate through the rest, updating `gcd` with the GCD of the current `gcd` and the next number. Here's how the `<MASK>` should be filled:

```python
from typing import List
def multiple_greatest_common_divisors(numbers: List[int]) -> int:
    import math
    gcd = numbers[0]  # Initialize with the first number in the list
    for num in numbers[1:]:
        gcd = math.gcd(gcd, num)
    return gcd if gcd > 1 else -1  # Check if GCD is greater than 1 before returning
```
