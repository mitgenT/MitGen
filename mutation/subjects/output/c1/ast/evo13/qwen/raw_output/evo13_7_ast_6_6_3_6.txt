Based on the given docstring, we need to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of each element in the list and update the `gcd` variable. If the GCD becomes 1, we should return -1. Here's how the code should be infilled:

```python
    if math.gcd(gcd, num) == 1:
        return -1
    gcd = math.gcd(gcd, num)
```

So the complete code would be:

```python
from typing import List
import math

def multiple_greatest_common_divisors(numbers: List[int]) -> int:
    gcd = numbers[0]
    for num in numbers[1:]:
        if math.gcd(gcd, num) == 1:
            return -1
        gcd = math.gcd(gcd, num)
    return gcd
```
