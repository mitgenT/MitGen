Based on the provided docstring, we need to check if the GCD is 1, and if it is, return -1. Here's the filled-in code:

```python
from typing import List
def multiple_greatest_common_divisors(numbers: List[int]) -> int:
    import math
    gcd = numbers[0]
    for num in numbers[1:]:
        gcd = math.gcd(gcd, num)
    if gcd == 1:
        return -1
    else:
        return gcd
```

Now the code has the correct condition to determine whether to return -1 or the actual GCD.
