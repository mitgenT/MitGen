Based on the provided docstring, we need to check if the GCD of the first two numbers is 1, and if so, return -1. Otherwise, we proceed with calculating the GCD of the entire list. Here's how to fill in the <MASK>:

```python
from typing import List
def multiple_greatest_common_divisors(numbers: List[int]) -> int:
    import math
    if numbers[0] == 1 and (len(numbers) > 1 and numbers[1] == 1):
        return -1
    else:
        gcd = math.gcd(numbers[0], numbers[1])
        for num in numbers[2:]:
            gcd = math.gcd(gcd, num)
    return gcd
```
