Based on the provided docstring, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all the elements in the list and check if it's 1. If it is, we should return -1. Here's how to fill in the `<MASK>` parts:

```python
from typing import List
def multiple_greatest_common_divisors(numbers: List[int]) -> int:
    import math
    gcd = numbers[0]
    for num in numbers[1:]:
        gcd = math.gcd(gcd, num)
    if gcd == 1:
        gcd = -1
    return gcd
```
