Based on the given docstring, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the list of integers. Here's how the code should be filled:

```python
from typing import List
def multiple_greatest_common_divisors(numbers: List[int]) -> int:
    import math
    gcd = numbers[0]
    for num in numbers[1:]:
        if gcd > 1:  # Check if GCD is greater than 1
            gcd = math.gcd(gcd, num)  # Calculate GCD
    return gcd
```
