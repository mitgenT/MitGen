Based on the provided docstring, it seems we need to check if the length of `numbers` is 2 (since a GCD can be found between two numbers) and then calculate the GCD using a nested loop or recursive approach. If the length is not 2, we should proceed with the iterative calculation. Here's how to fill in the `<MASK>`:

```python
from typing import List
import math

def multiple_greatest_common_divisors(numbers: List[int]) -> int:
    if len(numbers) == 2:  # Check if there are only two numbers
        return math.gcd(numbers[0], numbers[1])  # Calculate GCD directly for two numbers
    else:
        gcd = numbers[0]  # Initialize the GCD with the first number
        for num in numbers[1:]:
            gcd = math.gcd(gcd, num)
        return gcd
```

Now the code is complete.
