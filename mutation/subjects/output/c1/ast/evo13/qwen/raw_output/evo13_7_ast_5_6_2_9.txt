Based on the provided docstring, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all the numbers in the list and check if it's 1. If it is, we should return -1. Here's how the `<MASK>` part should be filled:

```python
    for num in numbers[1:]:
        gcd = math.gcd(gcd, num)
        if gcd == 1:
            return -1
    ```
    
So the complete code would be:

```python
from typing import List
import math

def multiple_greatest_common_divisors(numbers: List[int]) -> int:
    gcd = numbers[0]
    for num in numbers[1:]:
        gcd = math.gcd(gcd, num)
        if gcd == 1:
            return -1
    return gcd
```
