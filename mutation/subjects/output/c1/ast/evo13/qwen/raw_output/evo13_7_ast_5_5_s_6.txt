Based on the given docstring, we need to check if all the elements in the list have a common divisor other than 1. If they do, we calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) iteratively. Here's how to fill in the `<MASK>` parts:

```python
from typing import List
import math

def multiple_greatest_common_divisors(numbers: List[int]) -> int:
    gcd = numbers[0]
    
    # Iterate through the rest of the numbers
    for num in numbers[1:]:
        if gcd > 1:  # Only check if there's a common divisor other than 1
            gcd = math.gcd(gcd, num)
        else:
            break  # If GCD is 1, no need to continue

    return gcd
```

The output code with `<MASK>` filled is as above.
