Based on the provided docstring, we need to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the list elements and update `gcd` accordingly. Since we want to find the GCD of all numbers, we should use the `math.gcd()` function to calculate it between the current `gcd` and the current number from the list. If the GCD is 1, we need to return -1 at the end. Here's how to fill in the `<MASK>`:

```python
from typing import List
import math

def multiple_greatest_common_divisors(numbers: List[int]) -> int:
    gcd = numbers[0]
    for num in numbers[1:]:
        if gcd == 1:  # Check if GCD is 1
            return -1
        gcd = math.gcd(gcd, num)
    return gcd
```

Now the code is complete with the appropriate logic.
