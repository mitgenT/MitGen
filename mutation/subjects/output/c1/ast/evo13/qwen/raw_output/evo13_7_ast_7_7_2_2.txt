Here's the code with the `<MASK>` parts filled in according to the provided docstring:

```python
from typing import List
def multiple_greatest_common_divisors(numbers: List[int]) -> int:
    import math
    gcd = numbers[0]
    for num in numbers[1:]:
        gcd = math.gcd(gcd, num)
    
    # Check if GCD is 1
    if gcd == 1:
        return -1
    
    # If GCD is not 1, return the GCD
    else:
        return gcd
```

Now the code is complete, and it calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of a list of integers and handles the case when the GCD is 1 as specified in the docstring.
