Based on the provided docstring, the function should calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all the numbers in the list. If the GCD is 1, it should return -1. Therefore, we need to initialize `gcd` with the first number in the list and then iterate through the rest of the list to update `gcd` using `math.gcd()`. Here's how to fill in `<MASK>`:

```python
from typing import List
def multiple_greatest_common_divisors(numbers: List[int]) -> int:
    import math
    gcd = numbers[0]  # Initialize with the first number
    for num in numbers[1:]:
        gcd = math.gcd(gcd, num)
    return gcd
```
