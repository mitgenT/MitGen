Based on the provided docstring, it seems like we need to check if the length of the `numbers` list is 2 (in which case the GCD would be -1) before proceeding with the calculation. If the length is greater than 2, we should calculate the GCD iteratively using the `math.gcd` function. Here's how to fill in `<MASK>`:

```python
from typing import List
import math

def multiple_greatest_common_divisors(numbers: List[int]) -> int:
    if len(numbers) == 2:
        return -1
    else:
        gcd = numbers[0]
        for num in numbers[1:]:
            gcd = math.gcd(gcd, num)
        return gcd
```
