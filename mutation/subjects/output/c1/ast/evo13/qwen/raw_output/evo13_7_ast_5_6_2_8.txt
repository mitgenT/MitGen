Based on the given docstring, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all the numbers in the list. We can use the `math.gcd` function iteratively to compute the GCD. If the GCD of all elements is 1, we should return -1. Let's fill in the `<MASK>` parts accordingly:

```python
from typing import List
import math

def multiple_greatest_common_divisors(numbers: List[int]) -> int:
    gcd = numbers[0]
    for num in numbers[1:]:
        gcd = math.gcd(gcd, num)
    if gcd == 1:
        gcd = -1
    return gcd
```

Now, the function correctly calculates the GCD of the input list and handles the case where the GCD is 1 by returning -1.
