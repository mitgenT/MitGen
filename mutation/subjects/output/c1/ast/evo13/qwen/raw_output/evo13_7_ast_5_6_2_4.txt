Based on the provided docstring, we need to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) for all the elements in the list and update `gcd` accordingly. Since the first element is used as the initial guess, we'll iterate through the list starting from the second element and use the `math.gcd()` function to find the GCD with the current `gcd`. If the GCD is not 1, we update `gcd`. Here's how to fill in `<MASK>`:

```python
from typing import List
import math

def multiple_greatest_common_divisors(numbers: List[int]) -> int:
    gcd = numbers[0]
    if len(numbers) > 1:  # Check if there's more than one element
        for num in numbers[1:]:
            gcd = math.gcd(gcd, num)
    if gcd == 1:
        return -1
    else:
        return gcd
```

Now the code is complete.
