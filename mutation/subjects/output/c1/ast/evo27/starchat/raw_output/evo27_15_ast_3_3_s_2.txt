## Output
```python
def flip_case_special(string: str, special_index: int) -> str:
    special_index %= len(string)
    result = ""
    for i, char in enumerate(string):
        if i == special_index:
            if char.isupper():
                result += char.lower()
            else:
                result += char
        else:
            if char.isupper():
                result += char.lower()
            else:
                result += char
    return result
```

In this problem, we need to iterate through each character of the input string and perform the case-flipping operation based on certain conditions. The `<MASK>` placeholder is removed, and a `result` string variable is initialized inside the function. Then, for each character, we check if its index matches the `special_index`. If it does, we perform the case-flipping operation based on whether the character is uppercase or lowercase. If it doesn't, we simply append the original character to the `result` string. Finally, we return the `result` string. This completes the given task.
