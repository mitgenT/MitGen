## Output:
```python
def flip_case_special(string: str, special_index: int) -> str:
    special_index %= len(string)
    result = ''
    for i, char in enumerate(string):
        if i == special_index:
            if char.isupper():
                result += char
            else:
                result += char.upper()
        else:
            if char.isupper():
                result += char.lower()
            else:
                result += char
    return result
```
Here, I filled the `<MASK>` with the proper condition based on the instructions given in the docstring, where the character at'special_index' should either remain lowercase or flip from uppercase to lowercase, while the rest of the characters should be swapped.

For Python, there's no need to explicitly state else: after the `if`. It's implicit in Python loops and conditionals that the else condition will be applied to the last if condition that hasn't been met. This was corrected in the given code.
