## Output
```python
def flip_case_special(string: str, special_index: int) -> str:
    special_index %= len(string)
    result = ''
    for i, char in enumerate(string):
        if i == special_index:
            if char.isupper():
                result += char.lower()
            else:
                result += char
        else:
            if char.isupper():
                result += char.lower()
            else:
                result += char.upper()
    return result
```
I swapped the cases of characters at the special index for all the other characters in the given string. For the character at the'special_index', if it's uppercase, I made it lowercase, but if it's lowercase, I kept it as is. If the'special_index' is out of range, it is treated as an index in a circular list. This program satisfies the given requirements.
