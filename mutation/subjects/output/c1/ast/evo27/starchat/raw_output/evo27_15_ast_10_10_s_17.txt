```Python
        elif i!= special_index:
            if char.isupper():
                result += char.lower()
            else:
                result += char.upper()
```

The provided solution replaces the missing parts of the given code based on the conditions described in the docstring. The `elif` condition checks if the current index is not the special index, and flips the case of the character accordingly. The `else` condition, which corresponds to the special index, checks if the character is uppercase and converts it to lowercase, or keeps it as is if it's already lowercase. The modified line correctly handles the case-flipping and special index requirements.
