```python
def flip_case_special(string: str, special_index: int) -> str:
    result = ''
    for i, char in enumerate(string):
        if i == special_index:
            if char.isupper():
                result += char.lower()
            else:
                result += char
        else:
            result += char.swapcase()
    return result
```

In this solution, I have traversed the input string character by character, and for each character, I check if its index matches the'special_index'. If it does, I perform the case conversion based on the current state of the character (uppercase or lowercase). If the index does not match the'special_index', I simply invert the case of the character and append it to the result string. This solution fulfills all the requirements specified in the given docstring.
