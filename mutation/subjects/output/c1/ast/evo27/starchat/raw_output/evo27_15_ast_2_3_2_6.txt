This program accepts a string and an index as inputs. It transforms the cases of all characters except the one at the'special_index' (if it's in the string's range). The'special_index' in this program is treated as a circular index, meaning if the given index is out of range, the program will use a remainder of the index divided by the length of the string as the new index. As such, the character at this new index will keep its initial case.
