Here is the complete Python program with the filled <MASK> in your example:

```python
def program(list1):  
    for i in range(0,len(list1)-1):  
        for j in range(len(list1)-1):  
            if(list1[j]>list1[j+1]):  
                temp = list1[j]  
                list1[j] = list1[j+1]
                list1[j+1] = temp  
    return list1                 
```

Now, for the new problem, here's the completed Python program with the filled <MASK>:

```python
def flip_case_special(string: str, special_index: int) -> str:
    special_index %= len(string)
    result = ''
    for i, char in enumerate(string):
        if i == special_index:
            if char.isupper():
                result += char.lower()
            else:
                result += char
        else:
            if char.isupper():
                result += char.lower()
            else:
                result += char.upper()
    return result
```

This program will go through each character in the given string. If the current index matches the'special_index', the character will be treated as per the docstring's requirements. If it's not a'special_index', it will simply reverse the case of the character. If'special_index' is out of range, it will be treated as an index in a circular list by taking the modulo of its length with the length of the string.

Now, let's test this function:

```python
print(flip_case_special('Hello', 0)) # Expected output: hELLO
print(flip_case_special('Hello', 5)) # Expected output: hELLO
print(flip_case_special('hello', 0)) # Expected output: HELLO
```
