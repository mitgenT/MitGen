```python
        elif char.islower():
            result += char.upper()
```
In the given example, we need to compare the character at index 'j' and 'j+1'. We swap them if the condition (list1[j] > list1[j+1]) is satisfied. The correct code satisfies this condition and swaps the elements.

In the second part, based on the given docstring, we need to change the character at'special_index' to lowercase while keeping other characters as is. If the character is lowercase, it needs to remain lowercase, and if it's uppercase, it should be converted to lowercase. The output will be 'hELLO' for 'Hello' as 'H' is at index 0. If'special_index' is out of range, we treat it as an index in a circular list. The correction here is to make the character at'special_index' lowercase if it's uppercase. So, for a character at'special_index', if it's uppercase, we add `char.lower()`. If it's lowercase, we add `char` directly to keep it as it is. If it doesn't match either condition, we keep the same behavior by adding `char` without any changes.
