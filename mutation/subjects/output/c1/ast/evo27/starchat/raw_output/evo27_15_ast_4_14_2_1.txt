## Output
```python
def flip_case_special(string: str, special_index: int) -> str:
    special_index %= len(string)
    result = ''
    for i, char in enumerate(string):
        if i == special_index:
            result += char.lower() if char.isupper() else char
        else:
            result += char.upper() if char.islower() else char
    return result

```

Here, `<MASK>` was replaced with a loop to iterate over the string, checking for the special index at each iteration. A new string, `result`, was formed by flipping the cases of the characters according to the problem's requirements. The `%=` operator was used to handle the circular list for the special index.
