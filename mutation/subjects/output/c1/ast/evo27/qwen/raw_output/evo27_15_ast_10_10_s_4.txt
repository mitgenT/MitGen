Here's the infilled code:

```python
def flip_case_special(string: str, special_index: int) -> str:
    special_index %= len(string)
    result = ''
    for i, char in enumerate(string):
        if i == special_index:
            if char.islower():
                result += char.upper()
            else:
                result += char.lower()
        elif char.isupper():
            result += char.lower()
        else:
            result += char
    return result
```

Explanation:
1. In the original code, we need to handle two cases for each character: if it's at the `special_index` or not.
2. When the character is not at the `special_index`, we simply check if it's uppercase and convert it to lowercase; otherwise, leave it as is. This is why we add `elif char.isupper():` and `else:` conditions.
3. For the character at `special_index`, if it's lowercase, we want to keep it as is, so we add the condition `if char.islower():` and use `result += char.lower()` instead of converting it to uppercase.
