Based on the provided docstring, we need to modify the given code such that if the character at `special_index` is uppercase, it becomes lowercase, and if it's lowercase, it remains as is. Here's the filled-in code:

```python
def flip_case_special(string: str, special_index: int) -> str:
    special_index %= len(string)
    result = ''
    for i, char in enumerate(string):
        if i == special_index:
            if char.isupper():
                result += char.lower()
            else:
                result += char
        else:
            if char.isupper():
                result += char.lower()
            else:
                result += char
    return result
```

Now the code reflects the requirements described in the docstring.
