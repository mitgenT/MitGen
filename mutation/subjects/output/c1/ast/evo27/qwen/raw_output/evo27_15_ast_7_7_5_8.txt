Based on the provided docstring, we should flip the case of the character at the `special_index` if it's uppercase, but only if it's not already lowercase. If it's already lowercase, we should keep it as is. Here's the updated code:

```python
def flip_case_special(string: str, special_index: int) -> str:
    special_index %= len(string)
    result = ''
    for i, char in enumerate(string):
        if i == special_index:
            if char.isupper():
                if char != char.lower():  # Check if it's not already lowercase
                    result += char.lower()
                else:
                    result += char  # Keep it as is if it's already lowercase
            else:
                result += char
        else:
            if char.isupper():
                result += char.lower()
            else:
                result += char
    return result
```

The `<MASK>` parts have been replaced with the logic explained in the docstring. Now the function should work as expected.
