Based on the provided docstring, we need to modify the code to handle the special case at `special_index`. Since we want to flip lowercase characters to uppercase and uppercase to lowercase, but not change the character at `special_index`, we can add an if-else condition inside the loop to check if the current index is equal to `special_index` or not.

Here's the infilled code:

```python
def flip_case_special(string: str, special_index: int) -> str:
    if 0 <= special_index < len(string):
        # If special_index is within the range, treat it as a normal character
        pass
    else:
        # If special_index is out of range, wrap it around to the valid index
        special_index %= len(string)

    result = ''
    for i, char in enumerate(string):
        if i == special_index:
            if char.islower():
                result += char.upper()
            else:
                result += char
        else:
            if char.isupper():
                result += char.lower()
            else:
                result += char
    return result
```

Now the function correctly handles the flipping logic while keeping the character at `special_index` unchanged or unchanged if it's already the desired case.
