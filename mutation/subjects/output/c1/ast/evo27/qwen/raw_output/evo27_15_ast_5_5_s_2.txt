Based on the provided docstring, we need to check if the current character is at the `special_index` position and apply the flipping condition accordingly. Here's the filled in code:

```python
def flip_case_special(string: str, special_index: int) -> str:
    special_index %= len(string)
    result = ''
    for i, char in enumerate(string):
        if i == special_index:
            if char.islower():
                result += char.upper()
            else:
                result += char
        else:
            if char.isupper():
                result += char.lower()
            else:
                result += char
    return result
```

Now the function works as described in the docstring, flipping lowercase characters to uppercase and uppercase to lowercase, with a special case for the character at the `special_index`.
