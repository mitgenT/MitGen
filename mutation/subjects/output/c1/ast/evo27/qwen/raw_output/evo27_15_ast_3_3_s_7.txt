Based on the provided docstring, we need to implement the condition where the character at `special_index` is treated differently from the rest. Here's the completed code:

```python
def flip_case_special(string: str, special_index: int) -> str:
    special_index %= len(string)
    
    # Check if the special character should be flipped or kept as is
    if string[special_index].islower():
        result = string[0:special_index] + string[special_index].upper() + string[special_index+1:]
    else:
        result = string[0:special_index] + string[special_index] + string[special_index+1:]
        
    for i, char in enumerate(string):
        if i == special_index:
            continue
        elif char.isupper():
            result += char.lower()
        else:
            result += char
            
    return result
```

This code handles the flipping or keeping as-is of the character at `special_index` according to the conditions described in the docstring. The rest of the characters in the string are properly converted as specified.
