Based on the provided docstring, we need to check if the current index (`i`) matches `special_index`. If it does, we should flip the case of the character if it's uppercase, otherwise, we should not change the case if it's already lowercase or keep it the same if it's uppercase.

Here's the completed code:

```python
def flip_case_special(string: str, special_index: int) -> str:
    special_index %= len(string)
    result = ''
    for i, char in enumerate(string):
        if i == special_index:
            if char.isupper():
                result += char.lower()
            else:
                result += char
        else:
            if char.isupper():
                result += char.lower()
            else:
                result += char
    return result
```

This code handles the conditions described in the docstring by checking if `i` is equal to `special_index`, and applying the flipping logic accordingly.
