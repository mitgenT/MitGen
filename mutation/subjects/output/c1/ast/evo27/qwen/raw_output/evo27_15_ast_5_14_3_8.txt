Based on the provided docstring, we should check the case of the character at the `special_index` and flip it accordingly while keeping other characters as their respective cases. Here's the infilled code:

```python
def flip_case_special(string: str, special_index: int) -> str:
    special_index %= len(string)
    result = ''
    for i, char in enumerate(string):
        if i == special_index:
            if char.isupper():
                result += char.lower()
            else:
                result += char
        else:
            result += char.swapcase()
    return result

```
