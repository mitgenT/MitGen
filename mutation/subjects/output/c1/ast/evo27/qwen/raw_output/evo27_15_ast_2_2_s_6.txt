Based on the provided docstring, we need to check if the current character is at the `special_index` and modify it according to the condition. If `special_index` is within the range or in a circular list, we'll keep the character as is if it's lowercase, but convert it to lowercase if it's uppercase. Here's how to fill in `<MASK>` in the code:

```python
def flip_case_special(string: str, special_index: int) -> str:
    # Calculate the effective index if special_index is out of range
    effective_index = special_index % len(string)

    result = ''
    for i, char in enumerate(string):
        if i == effective_index:
            if char.isupper():
                result += char.lower()
            else:
                result += char
        else:
            if char.isupper():
                result += char.lower()
            else:
                result += char
    return result
```

Now, the function `flip_case_special` works as described in the docstring.
