Based on the provided docstring, the logic for flipping lowercase to uppercase and vice versa should be implemented while preserving the character at the `special_index`. Here's how the code should look:

```python
def flip_case_special(string: str, special_index: int) -> str:
    special_index %= len(string)
    result = ''
    for i, char in enumerate(string):
        if i == special_index:
            if char.islower():
                result += char.upper()
            else:
                result += char.lower()
        else:
            if char.isupper():
                result += char.lower()
            elif char.islower():
                result += char.upper()
            else:
                result += char
    return result
```

The changes made are:

1. If `char` is lowercase at `special_index`, it's converted to uppercase.
2. If `char` is not lowercase at `special_index`, it's left as is (since it's either already correct or doesn't apply to the special rule).
3. For all other characters (`else` branch), if they're uppercase, they're converted to lowercase; otherwise, they're left as is.
