Here's the code with the `<MASK>` parts filled in:

```python
def flip_case_special(string: str, special_index: int) -> str:
    special_index %= len(string)
    result = ''
    for i, char in enumerate(string):
        if i == special_index:
            if char.isupper():
                result += char.lower()
            elif char.islower():
                # If it's lowercase, keep it as is
                result += char
        else:
            if char.isupper():
                result += char.lower()
            elif char.islower():  # Same condition as before
                result += char
    return result
```

The completed code now handles the flipping of case for the characters in the string based on the provided docstring.
