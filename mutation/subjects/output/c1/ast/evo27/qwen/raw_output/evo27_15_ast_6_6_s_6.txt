Based on the provided docstring, we need to modify the `flip_case_special` function to flip lowercase characters to uppercase and uppercase to lowercase, except for the character at the 'special_index'. Here's the completed code:

```python
def flip_case_special(string: str, special_index: int) -> str:
    special_index %= len(string)
    result = ''
    for i, char in enumerate(string):
        if i == special_index:
            # If the character is uppercase, make it lowercase
            if char.isupper():
                result += char.lower()
            # If the character is lowercase or already flipped, keep it as is
            elif char.islower():
                result += char
        else:
            # Flip the case of all other characters
            result += char.swapcase()
    return result
```

Now, the function correctly handles the requirements specified in the docstring.
