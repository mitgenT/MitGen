Based on the provided docstring, we need to modify the code such that if the current character is uppercase, it becomes lowercase only if it's not at the `special_index`. If it is at `special_index`, we keep it as is (since it can be either uppercase or lowercase). Here's the filled-in code:

```python
def flip_case_special(string: str, special_index: int) -> str:
    special_index %= len(string)
    result = ''
    for i, char in enumerate(string):
        if i == special_index:
            # If the character at the special index is uppercase, convert it to lowercase
            if char.isupper():
                result += char.lower()
            else:
                result += char
        else:
            # If the character is uppercase, convert it to lowercase
            if char.isupper():
                result += char.lower()
            else:
                result += char
    return result
```

This should give the desired behavior as described in the docstring.
