Based on the provided docstring, we need to check the character case for each non-'special_index' position. If the character is lowercase, leave it as is. Here's the completed code:

```python
def flip_case_special(string: str, special_index: int) -> str:
    special_index %= len(string)
    result = ''
    for i, char in enumerate(string):
        if i == special_index:
            if char.isupper():
                result += char.lower()
            elif char.islower():
                # If the character at the special index is lowercase, keep it as is
                pass
            else:
                result += char
        else:
            if char.isupper():
                result += char.lower()
            elif char.islower():
                # If the character is lowercase, leave it as is
                result += char
            else:
                result += char
    return result
```

Now, the `flip_case_special` function handles the conditions specified in the docstring.
