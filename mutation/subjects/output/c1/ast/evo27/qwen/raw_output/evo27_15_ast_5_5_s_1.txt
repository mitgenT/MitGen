Based on the provided docstring, we need to check if the current character is at the `special_index` and apply the flipping rule accordingly. Here's the filled-in code:

```python
def flip_case_special(string: str, special_index: int) -> str:
    special_index %= len(string)
    result = ''
    for i, char in enumerate(string):
        if i == special_index:
            if char.isupper():
                result += char.lower()
            else:
                result += char
        else:
            if char.isupper():
                result += char.lower()
            else:
                result += char.upper()  # Flip lowercase characters
    return result
```

Now the code handles the flipping of case for all characters except the one at the `special_index`, where the condition is inverted to keep it as is if it's lowercase.
