Based on the provided docstring, we need to flip the case of the character at `special_index` if it's lowercase, and keep it as is if it's uppercase. Here's the filled-in code:

```python
def flip_case_special(string: str, special_index: int) -> str:
    special_index %= len(string)
    result = ''
    for i, char in enumerate(string):
        if i == special_index:
            if char.islower():
                result += char.upper()
            else:
                result += char
        else:
            if char.islower():
                result += char.upper()
            else:
                result += char.lower()
    return result
```

Now the function handles flipping the case of characters correctly according to the requirements described in the docstring.
