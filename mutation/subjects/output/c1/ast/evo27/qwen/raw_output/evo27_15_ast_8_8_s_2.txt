Based on the provided docstring, we need to handle the lowercase characters differently when they are at the `special_index`. If the character is lowercase, it should remain unchanged. Here's how to fill in the `<MASK>` parts in the code:

```python
def flip_case_special(string: str, special_index: int) -> str:
    special_index %= len(string)
    result = ''
    for i, char in enumerate(string):
        if i == special_index:
            if char.isupper():
                result += char.lower()
            else:
                result += char  # Keep lowercase characters unchanged
        else:
            if char.isupper():
                result += char.lower()
            else:  # Keep lowercase characters unchanged
                result += char
    return result
```

Now the code reflects the requirements described in the docstring.
