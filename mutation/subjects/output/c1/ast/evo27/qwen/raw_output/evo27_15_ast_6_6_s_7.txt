Based on the provided docstring, we need to modify the given code such that if `char` is uppercase, it becomes lowercase only if `i` is not equal to `special_index`. If `i` is equal to `special_index`, we keep the character as is (even if it's uppercase). Here's the updated code:

```python
def flip_case_special(string: str, special_index: int) -> str:
    special_index %= len(string)
    result = ''
    for i, char in enumerate(string):
        if i == special_index:
            if char.isupper():
                result += char
            else:
                result += char.lower()
        else:
            if char.isupper():
                result += char.lower()
            else:
                result += char
    return result
```

Now the function should work as described in the docstring.
