Based on the given docstring, we need to implement the behavior where if `char` is lowercase, it should remain as is only when `i` is not equal to `special_index`. Otherwise, it should follow the flipping logic for both uppercase and lowercase characters. Since `if char.islower()` is already checking for lowercase, we can simply add the flipped version of the character if `i` is not `special_index`. Here's the code with `<MASK>` filled:

```python
def flip_case_special(string: str, special_index: int) -> str:
    special_index %= len(string)
    result = ''
    for i, char in enumerate(string):
        if i == special_index:
            if char.isupper():
                result += char.lower()
            else:
                result += char
        else:
            if char.isupper():
                result += char.lower()
            else:
                # No need for an additional condition since it's only checked once outside the conditional block
                result += char.lower()  # Flipping lowercase characters
    return result
```

The output code now correctly implements the desired behavior described in the docstring.
