Based on the provided docstring, we need to iterate through the string, checking each character. If the character is lowercase, we'll flip it to uppercase; if it's uppercase, we'll flip it to lowercase, unless it's at the `special_index`. Here's the filled-in code:

```python
def flip_case_special(string: str, special_index: int) -> str:
    special_index %= len(string)
    result = ''
    
    for i in range(len(string)):
        char = string[i]
        
        # Flip case for all characters except the one at special_index
        if i != special_index:
            if char.islower():
                char = char.upper()
            elif char.isupper():
                char = char.lower()
                
        result += char
        
    return result
```

Now, when you run this code with the provided examples, it should produce the expected outputs.
