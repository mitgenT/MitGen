Based on the provided docstring, we need to modify the code to flip lowercase characters to uppercase and uppercase to lowercase, except for the character at `special_index`. Here's the filled in code:

```python
def flip_case_special(string: str, special_index: int) -> str:
    special_index %= len(string)
    result = ''
    for i, char in enumerate(string):
        if i == special_index:
            if char.isupper():
                result += char.lower()
            else:
                result += char
        elif char.islower():
            result += char.upper()
        else:
            result += char.lower()  # Flipping only lowercase characters, keeping uppercase as is
    return result
```

Now, the code should work as described in the docstring example.
