Based on the provided docstring, we need to modify the code to flip lowercase characters to uppercase and uppercase to lowercase, but keep lowercase characters at the `special_index` unchanged if it's lowercase. Here's how you can fill in the `<MASK>` parts:

```python
def flip_case_special(string: str, special_index: int) -> str:
    special_index %= len(string)
    result = ''
    for i, char in enumerate(string):
        if i == special_index:
            # If the character at special_index is uppercase, make it lowercase
            if char.isupper():
                result += char.lower()
            # If the character at special_index is lowercase, keep it as is
            elif char.islower():
                result += char
            else:
                result += char  # Other characters (non-lowercase or non-uppercase) stay the same
        else:
            # Flip lowercase characters to uppercase and uppercase to lowercase for all other indices
            if char.islower():
                result += char.upper()
            elif char.isupper():
                result += char.lower()
            else:
                result += char
    return result
```

Now the code has the correct logic to achieve the desired behavior as described in the docstring.
