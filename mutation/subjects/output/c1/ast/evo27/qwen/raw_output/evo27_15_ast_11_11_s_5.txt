Based on the provided docstring, we should check the case of the character and flip it accordingly if it's not at the `special_index`. Here's the code with the `<MASK>` filled in:

```python
def flip_case_special(string: str, special_index: int) -> str:
    special_index %= len(string)
    result = ''
    for i, char in enumerate(string):
        if i == special_index:
            if char.isupper():
                result += char.lower()
            else:
                result += char
        else:
            if not char.islower():  # Check if the character is uppercase
                result += char.lower()  # Convert to lowercase
            else:
                result += char  # Keep it as is
    return result
```

Now the code is complete and matches the expected behavior described in the docstring.
