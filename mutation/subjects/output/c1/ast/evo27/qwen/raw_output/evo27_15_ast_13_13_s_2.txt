Based on the provided docstring, we need to modify the code such that when the character at `special_index` is lowercase, it remains lowercase. Here's the modified code:

```python
def flip_case_special(string: str, special_index: int) -> str:
    special_index %= len(string)
    result = ''
    for i, char in enumerate(string):
        if i == special_index:
            if char.isupper():
                result += char.lower()
            elif char.islower():  # If character at special_index is lowercase, keep it as is
                result += char
            else:  # Handle other characters (should not happen in this context, but included for completeness)
                result += char
        else:
            if char.isupper():
                result += char.lower()
            elif char.islower():  # If the character is lowercase, change it to uppercase
                result += char.upper()
            else:
                result += char
    return result
```

Now, the function will correctly flip lowercase characters to uppercase and uppercase characters to lowercase, while keeping lowercase characters at `special_index` unchanged.
