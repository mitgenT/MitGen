Based on the given docstring, we need to flip the character to lowercase if it's uppercase, except when it's at the `special_index`. Here's the filled-in code:

```python
def flip_case_special(string: str, special_index: int) -> str:
    special_index %= len(string)
    result = ''
    for i, char in enumerate(string):
        if i == special_index:
            if char.isupper():
                result += char.lower()
            else:
                result += char
        else:
            if char.isupper():
                result += char.lower()
            else:
                result += char
    return result

```

The `<MASK>` part has been replaced with the correct logic to maintain the behavior described in the docstring.
