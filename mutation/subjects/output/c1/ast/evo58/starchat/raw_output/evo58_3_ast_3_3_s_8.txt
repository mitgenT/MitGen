```Python
    common_list = list(set(l1) & set(l2))
    if len(common_list) < n:
        return common_list
    else:
        return common_list[:n]
```

In the above solution, the `common_list` is initially created by finding the intersection of two input lists. Then, `common_list.sort(key=lambda x: (-len(x), l1.index(x)))` is used to sort the elements first by length in descending order and then by index position in `l1` in ascending order. If the length of the `common_list` is less than `n`, the original list is returned, otherwise, the first `n` elements are returned.
