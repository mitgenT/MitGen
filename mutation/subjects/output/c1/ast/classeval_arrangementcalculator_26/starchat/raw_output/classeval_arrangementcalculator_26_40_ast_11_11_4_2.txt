```python
        if m is None or n == m:
            if n == 0:
                return 1
```

The updated `ArrangementCalculator.count` function now correctly handles the case when `m` is not provided or equals `n`, returning the factorial of `n` when the case applies. This is done using a new condition `if n == 0` inside the `if` statement. This handles the edge case when n = m = 0 (which would otherwise return 0! = 1, as a factorial is undefined for 0).
