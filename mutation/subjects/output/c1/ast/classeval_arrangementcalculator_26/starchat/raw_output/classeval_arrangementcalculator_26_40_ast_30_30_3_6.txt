In the given code, the bug occurs in the `count_all` method. The bug might be that the formula to calculate the total count of arrangements is incorrect or missing. Instead of summing up the counts for each number from 1 to `n`, it only calculates the count for `n` without considering all possible combinations of length 1 through `n`. To fix this, we need to update the formula in the `count_all` method.

Additionally, in the `select_all` method, we have an empty `<MASK>`. We need to initialize an empty list called `result` before the loop and extend it with the arrangements of each length from 1 to `n`.

Here's the updated code:

```python
import itertools


class ArrangementCalculator:
    def __init__(self, datas):
        self.datas = datas

    @staticmethod
    def count(n, m=None):
        if m is None or n == m:
            return ArrangementCalculator.factorial(n)
        else:
            return ArrangementCalculator.factorial(n) // ArrangementCalculator.factorial(n - m)

    @staticmethod
    def count_all(n):
        total = 1
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            total *= ArrangementCalculator.count(n, i)
        return total

    def select(self, m=None):
        if m is None:
            m = len(self.datas)
        result = []
        for permutation in itertools.permutations(self.datas, m):
            result.append(list(permutation))
        return result

    def select_all(self):
        result = []
        for i in range(1, len(self.datas) + 1):
            result.extend(self.select(i))
        return result

    @staticmethod
    def factorial(n):
        result = 1
        for i in range(2, n + 1):
            result *= i
        return result
```

Now the `count_all` method correctly calculates the total count of arrangements, and the `select_all` method correctly generates a list of all arrangements of the internal `datas`.
