return result  

The bug location is in the factorial method where it doesn't return anything when `n` equals `1`. To fix it, I need to add a condition that checks if `n` is equal to `1`, and if it is, return `1`.

Here is the updated code:

```python
    @staticmethod
    def factorial(n):
        """
        Calculates the factorial of a given number.
        :param n: int, the number to calculate the factorial.
        :return: int, the factorial of the given number.
        >>> ArrangementCalculator.factorial(4)
        24
        """
        result = 1
        for i in range(2, n + 1):
            result *= i
        if n == 1:
            return 1
        return result
```
