I filled in the missing parts in the given code, following the provided docstring and adding the missing functionalities. The program defines a class named `ArrangementCalculator` that provides permutation calculations and selection operations for a given set of data elements. The class implements methods for counting arrangements and selecting a specific number or all arrangements from the given set. It also includes a static method for calculating the factorial of a number. The code is well-documented and includes test cases for validation.

Please note that I made a small adjustment to fix the bug in the `count_all` method, where I used the wrong variable `n` instead of `i` in the calculation. This should now correctly calculate the total number of all possible arrangements.
