The given code contains several bugs and the <MASK> needs to be filled appropriately. Let's go through each part and fix it:

Bug 1:
Bug location is in the count_all() method. The total is supposed to be initialized as 1, not 0, since we are multiplying the factorials.

Bug 2:
Bug location is in the select_all() method. The line needs to be changed to extend the result list with the output of the select() method.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
import itertools

class ArrangementCalculator:
    def __init__(self, datas):
        self.datas = datas

    @staticmethod
    def count(n, m=None):
        if m is None or n == m:
            return ArrangementCalculator.factorial(n)
        else:
            return ArrangementCalculator.factorial(n) // ArrangementCalculator.factorial(n - m)

    @staticmethod
    def count_all(n):
        total = 1
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            total *= ArrangementCalculator.count(n, i)
        return total

    def select(self, m=None):
        if m is None:
            m = len(self.datas)
        result = []
        for permutation in itertools.permutations(self.datas, m):
            result.append(list(permutation))
        return result

    def select_all(self):
        result = []
        for i in range(1, len(self.datas) + 1):
            result.extend(self.select(i))
        return result

    @staticmethod
    def factorial(n):
        result = 1
        for i in range(2, n + 1):
            result *= i
        return result
```
