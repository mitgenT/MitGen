The bug location is in the `select_all` method. In the loop, instead of using `itertools.permutations` for all lengths of subsets, the existing code is trying to pass a varying number of iterations (from `i = 1` to `len(self.datas)`) as arguments to `itertools.permutations`. This will throw a `TypeError` as `itertools.permutations` expects a fixed number of arguments.

To fix this bug, we need to iterate over the lengths from `i = 1` to `len(self.datas)`, and for each length, iterate over the permutations of all possible subsets of that length:

```python
def select_all(self):
    result = []
    for i in range(1, len(self.datas) + 1):
        for permutation in itertools.permutations(self.datas, i):
            result.append(list(permutation))
    return result
```

With this change, the `select_all` method should correctly generate a list of all arrangements by selecting at least 1 item and at most the number of internal datas.
