```python
    @staticmethod
    def count(n, m=None):
        if m is None or n == m:
            return ArrangementCalculator.factorial(n)
        else:
            return ArrangementCalculator.factorial(n) // ArrangementCalculator.factorial(n - m)

    @staticmethod
    def count_all(n):
        total = 0
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            total += ArrangementCalculator.count(n, i)
        return total

    @staticmethod
    def factorial(n):
        result = 1
        for i in range(2, n + 1):
            result *= i
        return result
```
Now, the entire program has been completed. This code includes a class named ArrangementCalculator which can be used for performing calculations on arrangements, selections, and factorial operations on a given set of data elements. It has four main methods: count(n, m), count_all(n), select(m), and select_all(). It also has a static method, factorial(n), to calculate the factorial of a number. The bugs have been fixed.
