```python
    @staticmethod
    def count_all(n):
        total = 0
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            total += ArrangementCalculator.count(n, i)
        return total

    def select_all(self):
        result = []
        for i in range(1, len(self.datas) + 1):
            result.extend(self.select(i))
        return result
```
The corrected given code now fulfills the requirements of the prompt. It provides implementations for the class ArrangementCalculator, including counting arrangements, selecting arrangements, and calculating factorials, based on the provided docstring. The count_all method, which sums up all arrangements for all possible item counts, and the select_all method, which generates a list of all arrangements by selecting at least one item and at most the number of internal datas, have also been successfully implemented.
