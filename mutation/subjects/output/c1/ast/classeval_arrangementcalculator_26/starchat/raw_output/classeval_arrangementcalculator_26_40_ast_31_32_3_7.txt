In the example code, the bug location was found in the 'count_all' method, where the calculation was not correct for finding the total count of all arrangements. The missing code should calculate the factorial for each value from 1 to 'n' and sum them up.

For the given code, we need to infill '<MASK>' in the'select_all' method. The correct code should iterate from 1 to the length of the internal datas and call the'select' method with each iteration value to generate a list of all arrangements.

Here is the revised code:

```python
import itertools


class ArrangementCalculator:
    def __init__(self, datas):
        self.datas = datas

    @staticmethod
    def count(n, m=None):
        if m is None or n == m:
            return ArrangementCalculator.factorial(n)
        else:
            return ArrangementCalculator.factorial(n) // ArrangementCalculator.factorial(n - m)

    @staticmethod
    def count_all(n):
        total = 0
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            total += ArrangementCalculator.count(n, i)
        return total

    def select(self, m=None):
        if m is None:
            m = len(self.datas)
        result = []
        for permutation in itertools.permutations(self.datas, m):
            result.append(list(permutation))
        return result

    def select_all(self):
        result = []
        for m in range(1, len(self.datas) + 1):
            result.extend(self.select(m))
        return result

    @staticmethod
    def factorial(n):
        result = 1
        for i in range(2, n + 1):
            result *= i
        return result
```

The code should be correct now.
