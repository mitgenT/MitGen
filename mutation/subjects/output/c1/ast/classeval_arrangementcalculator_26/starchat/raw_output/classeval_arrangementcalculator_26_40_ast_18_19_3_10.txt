```python
if m == 0:
    total = 1
else:
    for i in range(m+1):
        total += ArrangementCalculator.count(n, i)
```
I have filled in the <MASK> section according to the docstring and context given. The added code calculates the total count of all possible arrangements when m is set to 0, and for all other values of m it computes the sum of counts for each possible value of i from 0 to m (inclusive). This ensures that the count_all method works correctly and considers all arrangement possibilities.
