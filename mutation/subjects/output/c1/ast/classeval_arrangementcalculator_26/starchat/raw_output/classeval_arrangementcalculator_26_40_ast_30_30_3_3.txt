```python
def select_all(self):
    result = []
    for i in range(1, len(self.datas) + 1):
        result.extend(self.select(i))
    return result
```
Infilling <MASK> with `result.extend(self.select(i))` inside the `select_all` method makes it complete and correct. Now, this program should correctly calculate the number of permutations and select different combinations of data elements based on given parameters.
