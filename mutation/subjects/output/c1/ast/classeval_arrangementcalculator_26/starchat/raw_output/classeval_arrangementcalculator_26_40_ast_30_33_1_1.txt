```python
def select_all(self):
    result = []
    for r in range(1, len(self.datas)+1):
        for permutation in itertools.permutations(self.datas, r):
            result.append(list(permutation))
    return result
```

The `select_all` method was filled in by adding a loop over the range from 1 to the number of elements in `self.datas` (inclusive). Inside this loop, we use `itertools.permutations` to generate all permutations of `self.datas` of length `r`, and append them to the `result` list. Finally, we return the `result` list.
