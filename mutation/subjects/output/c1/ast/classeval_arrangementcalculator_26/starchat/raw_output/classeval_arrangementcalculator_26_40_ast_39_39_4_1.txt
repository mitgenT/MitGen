```python
    @staticmethod
    def factorial(n):
        result = 1
        for i in range(2, n + 1):
            result *= i  # bug fixed here
        return result
```

The bug in the given code is in the static method `factorial()`. The bug occurs in the line where the `result` variable is updated in the for loop. In the original code, `result` is multiplied by `i`, but it should be updated by itself. After fixing the bug, it correctly calculates the factorial of a given number.
