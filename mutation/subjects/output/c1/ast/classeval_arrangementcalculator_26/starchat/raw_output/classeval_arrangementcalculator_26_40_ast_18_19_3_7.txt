```python
if m == 0:
    return 1
else:
    return ArrangementCalculator.factorial(n) // ArrangementCalculator.factorial(n - m)
```

In the code above, the `<MASK>` was replaced to fix the bug in the `count_all()` method. Specifically, when `m` equals to `0`, the method should return `1` (since there is exactly 1 way to choose 0 items). Without this fix, the method would return `0` in that case.
