In the given code, the <MASK> should be filled in the count_all method. The bug occurs when trying to iterate directly over the range (1 to n+1), but the arrangement count for each number of elements (from 1 to n) is being calculated and extended to the result list. We should correct the range to correctly calculate the total number of all arrangements. 

Here is the corrected code:

```python
import itertools


class ArrangementCalculator:
    def __init__(self, datas):
        self.datas = datas

    @staticmethod
    def count(n, m=None):
        if m is None or n == m:
            return ArrangementCalculator.factorial(n)
        else:
            return ArrangementCalculator.factorial(n) // ArrangementCalculator.factorial(n - m)

    @staticmethod
    def count_all(n):
        total = 0
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            total += ArrangementCalculator.factorial(n) // ArrangementCalculator.factorial(n - i)
        return total

    def select(self, m=None):
        if m is None:
            m = len(self.datas)
        result = []
        for permutation in itertools.permutations(self.datas, m):
            result.append(list(permutation))
        return result

    def select_all(self):
        result = []
        for i in range(1, len(self.datas) + 1):
            result.extend(self.select(i))
        return result

    @staticmethod
    def factorial(n):
        result = 1
        for i in range(2, n + 1):
            result *= i
        return result
```

This corrected code accurately calculates the total number of arrangements (combinations) by choosing at least 1 item and at most n items from the given n items. The range from 1 to n+1 in the count_all method is replaced with a loop that correctly accumulates the factorials to calculate the total. The itertools.permutations function is used to generate the arrangements accurately.
