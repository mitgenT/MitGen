In the given code, the <MASK> needs to be filled with:

```python
self.datas = datas
```

So, the complete program is as follows:

```python
import itertools


class ArrangementCalculator:
    def __init__(self, datas):
        self.datas = datas

    @staticmethod
    def count(n, m=None):
        if m is None or n == m:
            return ArrangementCalculator.factorial(n)
        else:
            return ArrangementCalculator.factorial(n) // ArrangementCalculator.factorial(n - m)

    @staticmethod
    def count_all(n):
        total = 0
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            total += ArrangementCalculator.count(n, i)
                                             #bug location
    def select(self, m=None):
        if m is None:
            m = len(self.datas)
        result = []
        for permutation in itertools.permutations(self.datas, m):
            result.append(list(permutation))
        return result

    def select_all(self):
        result = []
        for i in range(1, len(self.datas) + 1):
            result.extend(self.select(i))
        return result

    @staticmethod
    def factorial(n):
        result = 1
        for i in range(2, n + 1):
            result *= i
        return result
```

The bug mentioned in the count_all() method is located at the comment: `#bug location`. However, since there is no issue described in the comment, it's hard to determine what exactly is wrong with the code. If you have a specific bug in mind, please provide additional details.
