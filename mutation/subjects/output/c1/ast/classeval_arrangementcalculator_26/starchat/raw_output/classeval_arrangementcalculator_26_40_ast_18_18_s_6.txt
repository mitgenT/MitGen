```python
        if m is None or m == 0:
            return 1
        else:
            return ArrangementCalculator.factorial(n) // ArrangementCalculator.factorial(n - m)
```
In the given code, I have completed the missing part in the count_all method by adding an additional condition to check if `m` is None or zero. If `m` is None or zero, it returns 1, otherwise it computes the count of arrangements using the factorial method.
