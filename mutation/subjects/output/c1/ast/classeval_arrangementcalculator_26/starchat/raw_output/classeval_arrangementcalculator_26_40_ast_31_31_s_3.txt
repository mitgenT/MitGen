```python
    def select_all(self):
        result = []
        for i in range(1, len(self.datas) + 1):
            result.extend(self.select(i))
        return result
```
I added a for loop that iterates from 1 to the length of `self.datas` (inclusive). For each iteration, it extends the `result` list with the output of `self.select(i)`, thus ensuring that all arrangements (with varying numbers of selected items) are added to the `result` list.
