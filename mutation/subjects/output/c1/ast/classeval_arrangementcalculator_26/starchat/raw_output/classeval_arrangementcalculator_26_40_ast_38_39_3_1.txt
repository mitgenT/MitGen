```python
    @staticmethod
    def factorial(n):
        result = 1
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            result *= i
        return result
```
In the given code, the `<MASK>` was replaced with a for loop to calculate the factorial. The loop starts from 1 to `n` and multiplies each number into the `result` variable, resulting in the factorial of the input number `n`. The loop completes the calculation of the factorial.
