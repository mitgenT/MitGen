```python

class ArrangementCalculator:
    def __init__(self, datas):
        self.datas = datas

    @staticmethod
    def count(n, m=None):
        if m is None or n == m:
            return ArrangementCalculator.factorial(n)
        else:
            return ArrangementCalculator.factorial(n) // ArrangementCalculator.factorial(n - m)

    @staticmethod
    def count_all(n):
        return 2 ** n  # This line was previously the bug location
                    
    def select(self, m=None):
        if m is None:
            m = len(self.datas)
        result = []
        for permutation in itertools.permutations(self.datas, m):
            result.append(list(permutation))
        return result

    def select_all(self):
        result = []
        for i in range(1, len(self.datas) + 1):
            result.extend(self.select(i))
        return result

    @staticmethod
    def factorial(n):
        result = 1
        for i in range(2, n + 1):
            result *= i
        return result
```

In the code above, the bug location was identified to be in the `count_all` method. Instead of calculating the count of all arrangements as the factorial of n, the program now correctly calculates it as the power of 2 raised to the n (`2 ** n`). This aligns with the given docstring, which states that the `ArrangementCalculator.count_all(n)` method should return the total number of all possible arrangements (2^n).
