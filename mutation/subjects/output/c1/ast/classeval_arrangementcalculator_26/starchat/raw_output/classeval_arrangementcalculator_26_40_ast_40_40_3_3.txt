```python
    @staticmethod
    def factorial(n):
        result = 1
        for i in range(2, n + 1):
            result *= i
        return result
```

The corrected `factorial` method should return `result`, as it is the final computed factorial. Here, `result` is not being returned which is why an error might occur when this static method is called. The bug location in the `count_all` method was where the calculation inside the for loop was missing the `return` statement. The corrected version is provided above.
