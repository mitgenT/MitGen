```python
    @staticmethod
    def factorial(n):
        result = 1
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            result *= i
        return result
```
In the example code, the <MASK> was replaced with a for loop that iterates from 1 to `n` (inclusive) and multiplies each value of `i` to the `result` variable to calculate the factorial of a given number `n`.
