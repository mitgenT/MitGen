```python
    if m is not None and n > m:
        return ArrangementCalculator.factorial(n) // ArrangementCalculator.factorial(n - m)
    else:
        return ArrangementCalculator.factorial(n)

```
I filled the <MASK> with code to handle the case where m is not None and n is greater than m, which is for calculating permutations of a specified size. Then I provided the correct return statement for both cases: to calculate the factorial of n when m is None or n equals m, and to calculate the factorial of n divided by the factorial of n minus m when m is not None and n is greater than m. I also fixed the indentation issue in the count_all method to properly count the arrangements based on the size chosen.
