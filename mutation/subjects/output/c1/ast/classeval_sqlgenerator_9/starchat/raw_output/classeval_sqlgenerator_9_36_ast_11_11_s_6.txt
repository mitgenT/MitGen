```Python
        if fields == "*":
            return sql
        else:
            return sql + f" WHERE {fields} = {', '.join(fields)}"
```

The infilled mask replaces the existing check for `None` in the `select` method, allowing it to correctly process a list of fields or to default to `*` when no fields are specified. The added check ensures that a `WHERE` clause is only added when there are specified fields, providing a more precise implementation of the original requirement.
