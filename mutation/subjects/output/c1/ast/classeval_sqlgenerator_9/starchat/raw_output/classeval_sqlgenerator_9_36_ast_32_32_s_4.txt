```python
def select_female_under_age(self, age):
    condition = f"age < {age} AND gender = 'female'"
    return self.select(condition=condition) + ";"

def select_by_age_range(self, min_age, max_age):
    condition = f"age BETWEEN {min_age} AND {max_age}"
    return self.select(condition=condition) + ";"
```
In the solution, I have completed the'select_female_under_age' and'select_by_age_range' methods by calling the'select' method and providing the appropriate condition string.
