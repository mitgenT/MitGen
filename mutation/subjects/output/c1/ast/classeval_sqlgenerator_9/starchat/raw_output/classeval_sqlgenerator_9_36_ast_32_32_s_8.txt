```Python
        sql = f"SELECT * FROM {self.table_name} WHERE {condition}"
        return sql + ";"
```

```Python
        if condition is not None:
            condition += f" AND {condition}"
        else:
            condition = f"age < {age} AND gender = 'female'"
        sql = f"SELECT * FROM {self.table_name} WHERE {condition}"
        return sql + ";"
```
