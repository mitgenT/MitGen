```python
    def select_female_under_age(self, age):
        condition = f"age < {age} AND gender = 'female'"
        return self.select("*", condition)

    def select_by_age_range(self, min_age, max_age):
        condition = f"age BETWEEN {min_age} AND {max_age}"
        return self.select("*", condition)
```

In the code above, I've filled in the <MASK>s by calling the select method with the appropriate arguments: the asterisk '*' to select all fields, and the conditions for selecting female individuals under a specified age or selecting records within a specified age range.
