```python
    def select_female_under_age(self, age):
        condition = f"age < {age} AND gender = 'female'"
        return self.select("*", condition)

    def select_by_age_range(self, min_age, max_age):
        condition = f"age BETWEEN {min_age} AND {max_age}"
        return self.select("*", condition)
```
In the given code, <MASK> is replaced with the return statement of the `select` method with specific fields and conditions for the methods `select_female_under_age` and `select_by_age_range`. This code ensures that these methods use the `select` method to generate the SQL statements for the specified conditions.
