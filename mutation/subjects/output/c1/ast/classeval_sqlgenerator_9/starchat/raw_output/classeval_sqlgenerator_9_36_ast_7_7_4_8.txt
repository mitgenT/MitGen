```python
fields = "*" if fields is None else ", ".join(fields)
```

                        The corrected code for the select method is:
                        ```Python
                        def select(self, fields=None, condition=None):
                            fields = "*" if fields is None else ", ".join(fields)
                            sql = f"SELECT {fields} FROM {self.table_name}"
                            if condition is not None:
                                sql += f" WHERE {condition}"
                            return sql + ";"
                        ```

                        Now, the function will work correctly when either `fields` or `condition` is not provided.
