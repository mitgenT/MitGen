```python
def delete(self, condition):
    if condition is not None:
        sql = f"DELETE FROM {self.table_name} WHERE {condition}"
    else:
        sql = f"DELETE FROM {self.table_name}"
    return sql + ";"
```

This solution completes the SQLGenerator class by filling in the missing code for the `delete` method. It checks if a condition is provided and constructs the SQL statement accordingly.
