In the `select_female_under_age(self, age)` function, you need to provide the condition for selecting females under a specific age. You can also use the `select` method with this condition. Below is the updated code:

```python
class SQLGenerator:
    def __init__(self, table_name):
        self.table_name = table_name

    #... Existing functions...

    def select_female_under_age(self, age):
        condition = f"age < {age} AND gender = 'female'"
        return self.select(condition=condition)

    #... Existing functions...
```
