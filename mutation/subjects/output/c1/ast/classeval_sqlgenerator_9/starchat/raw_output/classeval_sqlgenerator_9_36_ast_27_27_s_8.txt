```python
def delete(self, condition):
    if condition:
        sql = f"DELETE FROM {self.table_name} WHERE {condition}"
    else:
        sql = f"DELETE FROM {self.table_name}"
    return sql + ";"
```
In the given code, `<MASK>` should be replaced with a conditional statement. If a condition is provided in the `delete()` function, the SQL statement will contain that condition. If no condition is given, the function will generate a delete SQL statement without a condition.
