In the given example, `<MASK>` in the Bubble Sort code is correctly filled with `list1[j] = list1[j+1]` and `list1[j+1] = temp`.

Now, let's fill in the missing parts of the given SQLGenerator class. 

In the `select` method, you have added an incomplete condition to `if fields is None:`. We need to replace it with:

```python
fields = "* " if fields is None else ", ".join(fields)
```

In the `select` method, you have an incomplete SQL statement after the `fields` and `conditions` handling. We can complete it using f-string formatting:

```python
sql = f"SELECT {fields} FROM {self.table_name}"
```

So, the final solution for the `select` method looks like:

```python
def select(self, fields=None, condition=None):
    fields = "* " if fields is None else ", ".join(fields)
    sql = f"SELECT {fields} FROM {self.table_name}"
    if condition is not None:
        sql += f" WHERE {condition}"
    return sql + ";"
```

Similarly, in the `select_female_under_age` and `select_by_age_range` methods, we are missing the SQL statement initialization, and we are passing the condition directly to the `select` method without using `fields` parameter. We can fix this by modifying the methods like this:

```python
def select_female_under_age(self, age):
    condition = f"age < {age} AND gender = 'female'"
    return self.select(condition=condition)

def select_by_age_range(self, min_age, max_age):
    condition = f"age BETWEEN {min_age} AND {max_age}"
    return self.select(condition=condition)
```

With these changes, the entire program is:

```python
class SQLGenerator:
    def __init__(self, table_name):
        self.table_name = table_name

    def select(self, fields=None, condition=None):
        fields = "* " if fields is None else ", ".join(fields)
        sql = f"SELECT {fields} FROM {self.table_name}"
        if condition is not None:
            sql += f" WHERE {condition}"
        return sql + ";"

    def insert(self, data):
        fields = ", ".join(data.keys())
        values = ", ".join([f"'{value}'" for value in data.values()])
        sql = f"INSERT INTO {self.table_name} ({fields}) VALUES ({values})"
        return sql + ";"

    def update(self, data, condition):
        set_clause = ", ".join([f"{field} = '{value}'" for field, value in data.items()])
        sql = f"UPDATE {self.table_name} SET {set_clause} WHERE {condition}"
        return sql + ";"

    def delete(self, condition):
        sql = f"DELETE FROM {self.table_name} WHERE {condition}"
        return sql + ";"

    def select_female_under_age(self, age):
        condition = f"age < {age} AND gender = 'female'"
        return self.select(condition=condition)

    def select_by_age_range(self, min_age, max_age):
        condition = f"age BETWEEN {min_age} AND {max_age}"
        return self.select(condition=condition)
```

This implementation of the `SQLGenerator` class satisfies all the requirements mentioned in the docstring. It generates SQL statements for various operations on a table.
