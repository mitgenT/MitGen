In the given code, the `select_female_under_age` and `select_by_age_range` methods need to be implemented by filling in `<MASK>` with the generated SQL statement based on the specified conditions. The correct code would be:

```python
def select_female_under_age(self, age):
    condition = f"age < {age} AND gender = 'female'"
    return self.select("*", condition) + ";"

def select_by_age_range(self, min_age, max_age):
    condition = f"age BETWEEN {min_age} AND {max_age}"
    return self.select("*", condition) + ";"
```

Now, the `SQLGenerator` class has the complete implementation of all the required methods, including `select`, `insert`, `update`, `delete`, `select_female_under_age`, and `select_by_age_range`.

You can use this class to generate SQL statements for common operations on a table. For example:

```python
sql = SQLGenerator('table1')
print(sql.select(['field1', 'field2'], 'field3 = value1'))
print(sql.insert({'key1': 'value1', 'key2': 'value2'}))
print(sql.update({'field1': 'new_value1', 'field2': 'new_value2'}, "field3 = value1"))
print(sql.delete("field1 = value1"))
print(sql.select_female_under_age(30))
print(sql.select_by_age_range(20, 30))
```

The output will be:

```
SELECT field1, field2 FROM table1 WHERE field3 = value1;
INSERT INTO table1 (key1, key2) VALUES ('value1', 'value2');
UPDATE table1 SET field1 = 'new_value1', field2 = 'new_value2' WHERE field3 = value1;
DELETE FROM table1 WHERE field1 = value1;
SELECT * FROM table1 WHERE age < 30 AND gender = 'female';
SELECT * FROM table1 WHERE age BETWEEN 20 AND 30;
```
