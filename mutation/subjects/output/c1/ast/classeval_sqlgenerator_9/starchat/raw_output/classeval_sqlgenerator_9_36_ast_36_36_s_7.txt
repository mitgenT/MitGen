```python
def select_female_under_age(self, age):
    condition = f"age < {age} AND gender = 'female'"
    return self.select(condition=condition)

def select_by_age_range(self, min_age, max_age):
    condition = f"age BETWEEN {min_age} AND {max_age}"
    return self.select(condition=condition)
```
This infill completes the SQLGenerator class by providing implementations for the `select_female_under_age` and `select_by_age_range` methods, using the `select` method with the appropriate condition.
