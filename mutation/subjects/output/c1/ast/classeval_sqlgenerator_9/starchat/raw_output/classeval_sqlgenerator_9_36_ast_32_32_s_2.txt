```python
def select_female_under_age(self, age):
    condition = f"age < {age} AND gender = 'female'"
    return self.select(condition=condition)

def select_by_age_range(self, min_age, max_age):
    condition = f"age BETWEEN {min_age} AND {max_age}"
    return self.select(condition=condition)
```
I completed the Python code for the SQLGenerator class. The methods select_female_under_age and select_by_age_range use the existing select method, replacing the condition parameter with their own conditions. This results in the generation of SQL statements to select females under a specified age, and to select records within a specified age range, respectively.
