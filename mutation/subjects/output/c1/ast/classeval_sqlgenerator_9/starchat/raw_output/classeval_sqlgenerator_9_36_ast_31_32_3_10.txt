In the `select_female_under_age` method, you can infill <MASK> with the following:

```python
if condition:
    condition = f"age < {age} AND gender = 'female'"
return self.select(condition=condition)
```
This code modifies the `condition` parameter within the `select` method to select females under the specified age.
