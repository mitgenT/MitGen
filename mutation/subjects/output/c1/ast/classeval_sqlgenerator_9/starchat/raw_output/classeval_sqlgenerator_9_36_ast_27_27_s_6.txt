In the given Python code snippet, the `<MASK>` refers to missing or incomplete code. The code needs to be completed by filling in the missing parts.

First, let's analyze the given code:

```python
def delete(self, condition):
    <MASK>
    return sql + ";"
```

In this `delete` function, `sql` variable is not defined. It seems like there was an attempt to use a previous SQL statement generated by one of the other functions, such as `select`, `insert`, or `update`. Since no SQL statement is generated by the `delete` function itself, we need to create a new SQL statement specifically for the delete operation.

Here's the completed `delete` function:

```python
def delete(self, condition):
    sql = f"DELETE FROM {self.table_name}"
    if condition is not None:
        sql += f" WHERE {condition}"
    return sql + ";"
```

Now, the entire program is complete with the missing `delete` function infill:

```python
class SQLGenerator:
    def __init__(self, table_name):
        self.table_name = table_name

    def select(self, fields=None, condition=None):
        if fields is None:
            fields = "*"
        else:
            fields = ", ".join(fields)
        sql = f"SELECT {fields} FROM {self.table_name}"
        if condition is not None:
            sql += f" WHERE {condition}"
        return sql + ";"

    def insert(self, data):
        fields = ", ".join(data.keys())
        values = ", ".join([f"'{value}'" for value in data.values()])
        sql = f"INSERT INTO {self.table_name} ({fields}) VALUES ({values})"
        return sql + ";"

    def update(self, data, condition):
        set_clause = ", ".join([f"{field} = '{value}'" for field, value in data.items()])
        sql = f"UPDATE {self.table_name} SET {set_clause} WHERE {condition}"
        return sql + ";"

    def delete(self, condition):
        sql = f"DELETE FROM {self.table_name}"
        if condition is not None:
            sql += f" WHERE {condition}"
        return sql + ";"

    def select_female_under_age(self, age):
        condition = f"age < {age} AND gender = 'female'"
        return self.select(condition=condition)

    def select_by_age_range(self, min_age, max_age):
        condition = f"age BETWEEN {min_age} AND {max_age}"
        return self.select(condition=condition)
```
