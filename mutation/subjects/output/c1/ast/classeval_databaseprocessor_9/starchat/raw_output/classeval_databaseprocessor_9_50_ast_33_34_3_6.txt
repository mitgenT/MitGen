```python
    def search_database(self, table_name, name):

        conn = sqlite3.connect(self.database_name)
        cursor = conn.cursor()

        select_query = f"SELECT * FROM {table_name} WHERE name =?"
        cursor.execute(select_query, (name,))
        result = cursor.fetchall()

        conn.commit()
        conn.close()

        return result
```
In the provided solution, I've filled in the missing code for the `search_database` method, ensuring that the database connection and cursor are opened correctly and properly closed after executing the search query. The method now returns the matching rows from the specified table.
