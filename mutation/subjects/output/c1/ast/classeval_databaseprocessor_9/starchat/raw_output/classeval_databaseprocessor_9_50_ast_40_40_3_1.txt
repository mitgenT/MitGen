```python
    def search_database(self, table_name, name):

        conn = sqlite3.connect(self.database_name)
        cursor = conn.cursor()

        select_query = f"SELECT * FROM {table_name} WHERE name =?"
        cursor.execute(select_query, (name,))
        result = cursor.fetchall()

        conn.commit()
        conn.close()

        return result
```

We just need to move the `conn.commit()` and `conn.close()` lines to the end of `search_database` since you're returning result before closing the connection. In other functions like `insert_into_database` and `delete_from_database`, these lines are appropriately located before closing the connection.
