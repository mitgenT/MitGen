```python
conn = sqlite3.connect(self.database_name)
cursor = conn.cursor()

select_query = f"SELECT * FROM {table_name} WHERE name =?"
cursor.execute(select_query, (name,))
result = cursor.fetchall()

conn.close()
```

The modified code is provided above to complete the search_database method in the DatabaseProcessor class. This method connects to the SQLite database, creates a cursor, executes a SELECT query with the provided name, fetches all the matching rows, and finally closes the connection to the database.
