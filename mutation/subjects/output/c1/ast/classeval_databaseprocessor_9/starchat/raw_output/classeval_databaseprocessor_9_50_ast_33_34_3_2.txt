    def search_database(self, table_name, name):
        conn = sqlite3.connect(self.database_name)
        cursor = conn.cursor()

        select_query = f"SELECT * FROM {table_name} WHERE name =?"
        cursor.execute(select_query, (name,))
        result = cursor.fetchall()

        conn.close()
        return result
```
