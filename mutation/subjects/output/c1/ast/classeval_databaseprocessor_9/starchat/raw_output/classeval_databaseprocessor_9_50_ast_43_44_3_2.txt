```python
conn = sqlite3.connect(self.database_name)
cursor = conn.cursor()

delete_query = f"DELETE FROM {table_name} WHERE name =?"
cursor.execute(delete_query, (name,))

conn.commit()
conn.close()
```

In the provided code, I filled the `<MASK>` with the necessary database connection and cursor initialization, and the delete statement. This revised code provides a complete implementation of the `DatabaseProcessor` class, fulfilling the specified functionality of creating tables, inserting data, searching for data, and deleting data from the database.
