To complete the given code, replace `<MASK>` in the `insert_into_database` method as follows:

```python
def insert_into_database(self, table_name, data):
    conn = sqlite3.connect(self.database_name)
    cursor = conn.cursor()

    for item in data:
        insert_query = f"INSERT INTO {table_name} (name, age) VALUES (?,?)"
        cursor.execute(insert_query, (item['name'], item['age']))

    conn.commit()
    conn.close()
```

With these changes, you've correctly completed all placeholders in the provided code. The program is now a DatabaseProcessor class capable of performing tasks such as creating tables, inserting data, searching for data based on name, and deleting data from the database using SQLite in Python.
