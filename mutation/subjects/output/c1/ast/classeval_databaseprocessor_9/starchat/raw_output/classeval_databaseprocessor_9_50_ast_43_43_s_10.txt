In the `delete_from_database` method, you need to include error handling to ensure the database connection is established before executing the SQL statement. If there is a connection problem, the execution should fail gracefully. 

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def delete_from_database(self, table_name, name):

    try:
        conn = sqlite3.connect(self.database_name)
    except sqlite3.Error as e:
        print(f"Error connecting to the database: {e}")
        return

    cursor = conn.cursor()

    delete_query = f"DELETE FROM {table_name} WHERE name =?"
    cursor.execute(delete_query, (name,))

    conn.commit()
    conn.close()
```

This ensures that the program will not crash due to a connection issue and provides appropriate feedback to the user when such an error occurs.
