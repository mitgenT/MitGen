```python
def delete_from_database(self, table_name, name):

    conn = sqlite3.connect(self.database_name)
    cursor = conn.cursor()

    delete_query = f"DELETE FROM {table_name} WHERE name =?"
    cursor.execute(delete_query, (name,))

    conn.commit()
    conn.close()
```

In the solution, the `delete_from_database` method correctly executes a DELETE SQL query in the database, deleting rows where the 'name' matches the input name. This fills in the `<MASK>` in the given code snippet.
