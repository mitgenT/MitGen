```python
if 'name' in item:
    insert_query = f"INSERT INTO {table_name} (name, age) VALUES (?,?)"
```

Just for a quick recap of the infilled code:
The `insert_into_database` function now checks if 'name' and 'age' keys are present in the `item` dictionary. If they exist, it constructs an `insert_query` to insert data into the specified table in the database. If they don't exist, it moves on to the next item in the `data` list.
