To complete the given code, I will fill in the missing <MASK> parts. Here's the updated program:

```python
import sqlite3
import pandas as pd

class DatabaseProcessor:

    def __init__(self, database_name):
        self.database_name = database_name

    def create_table(self, table_name, key1, key2):
        conn = sqlite3.connect(self.database_name)
        cursor = conn.cursor()

        # Create table query with the provided table_name, key1, and key2
        create_table_query = f"CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS {table_name} (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, {key1} TEXT, {key2} INTEGER)"
        cursor.execute(create_table_query)

        conn.commit()
        conn.close()

    def insert_into_database(self, table_name, data):
        conn = sqlite3.connect(self.database_name)
        cursor = conn.cursor()

        # Loop through the data list and insert each item into the specified table
        for item in data:
            insert_query = f"INSERT INTO {table_name} (name, age) VALUES (?,?)"
            cursor.execute(insert_query, (item['name'], item['age']))

        conn.commit()
        conn.close()

    def search_database(self, table_name, name):
        conn = sqlite3.connect(self.database_name)
        cursor = conn.cursor()

        # Execute a SELECT query to search the specified table for matching names
        select_query = f"SELECT * FROM {table_name} WHERE name =?"
        cursor.execute(select_query, (name,))
        result = cursor.fetchall()

        return result

    def delete_from_database(self, table_name, name):
        conn = sqlite3.connect(self.database_name)
        cursor = conn.cursor()

        # Execute a DELETE query to delete rows with the specified name from the table
        delete_query = f"DELETE FROM {table_name} WHERE name =?"
        cursor.execute(delete_query, (name,))

        conn.commit()
        conn.close()
```

The missing <MASK> in the `create_table` method has been filled with the code block that creates a connection to the database, executes a cursor object, and prepares the `CREATE TABLE` SQL query. The created table will have the `id` column as an `INTEGER PRIMARY KEY`, and the `key1` and `key2` columns as specified.

The missing <MASK> parts in the `insert_into_database`, `search_database`, and `delete_from_database` methods have been filled with the necessary code blocks to connect to the database, execute SQL queries, commit the changes, and close the connection.

Please let me know if you need any further assistance.
