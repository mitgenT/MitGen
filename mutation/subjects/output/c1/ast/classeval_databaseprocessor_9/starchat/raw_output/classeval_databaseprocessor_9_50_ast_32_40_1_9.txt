Infill <MASK> of the following code:

```python
def search_database(self, table_name, name):
    conn = sqlite3.connect(self.database_name)
    cursor = conn.cursor()

    search_query = f"SELECT * FROM {table_name} WHERE name =?"
    cursor.execute(search_query, (name,))
    results = cursor.fetchall()

    conn.close()

    return results
```

This fills the <MASK> placeholder in the search_database method, implementing the database search functionality as described in the given docstring. The method connects to the database, executes a SELECT query based on the provided table_name and name, retrieves all matching rows using cursor.fetchall(), and then closes the database connection. Finally, it returns the results.
