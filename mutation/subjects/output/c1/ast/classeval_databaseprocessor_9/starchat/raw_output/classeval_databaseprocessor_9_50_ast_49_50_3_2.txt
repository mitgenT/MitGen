```python
    def delete_from_database(self, table_name, name):

        conn = sqlite3.connect(self.database_name)
        cursor = conn.cursor()

        delete_query = f"DELETE FROM {table_name} WHERE name =?"
        cursor.execute(delete_query, (name,))

        conn.commit()
        conn.close()
```

I added the `conn.commit()` and `conn.close()` commands at the end of the delete function to finalize the deletion process in the database and close the connection.
