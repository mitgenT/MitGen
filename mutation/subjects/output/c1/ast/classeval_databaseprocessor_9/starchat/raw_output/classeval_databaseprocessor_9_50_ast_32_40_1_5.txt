```python
    def search_database(self, table_name, name):
        conn = sqlite3.connect(self.database_name)
        cursor = conn.cursor()

        search_query = f"SELECT * FROM {table_name} WHERE name =?"
        cursor.execute(search_query, (name,))

        result = cursor.fetchall()

        conn.close()
        return result
```
In the `search_database` function, we create a SQL query to select all rows from the specified table where the 'name' column matches the provided name. The results are then fetched using `fetchall()` and returned from the function. The connection to the database is closed after the operation is complete.
