The missing section can be filled in the'search_database' method as follows:

```python
def search_database(self, table_name, name):
    conn = sqlite3.connect(self.database_name)
    cursor = conn.cursor()

    select_query = f"SELECT * FROM {table_name} WHERE name =?"
    cursor.execute(select_query, (name,))

    rows = cursor.fetchall()
    conn.close()

    return rows
```

This will allow you to retrieve rows from the database based on a specified name. Each row will be returned as a tuple, where each element corresponds to a column value. If no matching rows are found, the method will return an empty list. 

Please note: This solution uses SQLite for the database management and doesn't use pandas. If pandas is required, you will have to adjust the code accordingly.
