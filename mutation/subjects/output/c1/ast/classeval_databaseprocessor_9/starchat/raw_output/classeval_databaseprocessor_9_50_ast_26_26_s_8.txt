```python
        if isinstance(item, dict) and 'name' in item and 'age' in item:
            cursor.execute(insert_query, (item['name'], item['age']))
```
In this solution, the infill <MASK> for the `insert_into_database()` method is complete based on the given docstring. The logic checks whether the `item` is a dictionary and contains both 'name' and 'age' as keys before executing the insert query. This prevents potential errors and ensures that only relevant data is inserted into the database.
