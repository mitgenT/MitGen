```python
if cursor.rowcount > 0:  
    cursor.execute(delete_query, (name,))
```
Infilling the `<MASK>` with `if cursor.rowcount > 0` allows the function to only execute the delete operation when at least one row was matched in the search query. This is a good practice to prevent accidental deletions when no rows meet the specified criteria.
