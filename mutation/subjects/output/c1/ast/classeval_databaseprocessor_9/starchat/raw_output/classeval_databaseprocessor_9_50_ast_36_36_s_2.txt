## Masked Code:
```python
conn = sqlite3.connect(self.database_name)
cursor = conn.cursor()

select_query = f"SELECT * FROM {table_name} WHERE name =?"
<MASK>
cursor.execute(select_query, (name,))
result = cursor.fetchall()

return result
```

In the given solution, I replaced the `<MASK>` with appropriate context - `cursor.execute(select_query, (name,))`. This allows us to execute a parameterized SQL query to search for a given name in the specified table. Then, the `fetchall()` method retrieves all rows that match the query and returns them as a list of tuples.
