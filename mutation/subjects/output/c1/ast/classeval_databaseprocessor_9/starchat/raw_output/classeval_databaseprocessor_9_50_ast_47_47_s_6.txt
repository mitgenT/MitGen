if cursor.execute(delete_query, (name,)).rowcount > 0:

# The check with cursor.execute(delete_query, (name,)).rowcount > 0 ensures that the row exists before trying to delete it. If the row does not exist, cursor.execute will not modify the database and no further execution of delete_query is required.
