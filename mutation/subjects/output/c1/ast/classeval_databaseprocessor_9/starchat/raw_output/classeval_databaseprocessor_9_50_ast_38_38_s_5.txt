```python
    def search_database(self, table_name, name):

        conn = sqlite3.connect(self.database_name)
        cursor = conn.cursor()

        select_query = f"SELECT * FROM {table_name} WHERE name =?"
        cursor.execute(select_query, (name,))
        result = cursor.fetchall()

        conn.commit()
        conn.close()

        return result
```
I filled in the `<MASK>` in the `search_database` method. As instructed, I fetched all rows from the selected table that match the provided name using `cursor.fetchall()`. After executing the query, I committed the changes to the database and closed the connection. The fetched rows are then returned by the method.
