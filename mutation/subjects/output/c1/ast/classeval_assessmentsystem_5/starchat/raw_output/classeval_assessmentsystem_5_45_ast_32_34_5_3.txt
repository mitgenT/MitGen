In the given code, the <MASK> placeholder should be replaced with'score >= 60' and 'count += 1' respectively. This infilling results in the following completed code:

```Python
class AssessmentSystem:
    def __init__(self):
        self.students = {}

    def add_student(self, name, grade, major):
        self.students[name] = {'name': name, 'grade': grade,'major': major, 'courses': {}}

    def add_course_score(self, name, course, score):
        self.students[name]['courses'][course] = score

    def get_gpa(self, name):
        if name in self.students and self.students[name]['courses']:
            return sum(self.students[name]['courses'].values()) / len(self.students[name]['courses'])
        else:
            return None

    def get_all_students_with_fail_course(self):
        students = []
        for name, student in self.students.items():
            for course, score in student['courses'].items():
                if score < 60:
                    students.append(name)
                    break
        return students

    def get_course_average(self, course):
        total = 0
        count = 0
        for student in self.students.values():
            if course in student['courses']:
                score = student['courses'][course]
                if score >= 60:
                    total += score
                    count += 1
        return total / count if count > 0 else None

    def get_top_student(self):
        top_student = None
        top_gpa = 0
        for name, student in self.students.items():
            gpa = self.get_gpa(name)
            if gpa is not None and gpa > top_gpa:
                top_gpa = gpa
                top_student = name
        return top_student
```

Now, the provided AssessmentSystem class includes all the methods as per the given docstring and functions as expected. It supports the following functionalities:

1. Adding a student
2. Adding a course score for a student
3. Getting the GPA of a student
4. Getting all the students who have failed at least one course
5. Getting the average score of a specific course
6. Getting the student with the highest GPA

You can now use this class to create an assessment system and perform various operations on students and their course scores.
