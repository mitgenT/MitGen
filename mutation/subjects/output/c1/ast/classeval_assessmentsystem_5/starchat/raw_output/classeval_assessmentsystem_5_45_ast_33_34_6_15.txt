In the given code, I filled in the `<MASK>` in the `get_course_average` method as shown below:

```python
class AssessmentSystem:
    #... existing code...

    def get_course_average(self, course):
        total = 0
        count = 0
        for student in self.students.values():
            if course in student['courses']:
                score = student['courses'][course]
                if score is not None:
                    total += score
                    count += 1
        return total / count if count > 0 else None

    #... existing code...
```

In this updated code, I added two lines inside the loop to check if the student has taken the given course and if the score is not `None`. If both conditions are true, I add the score to the total and increment the count. Finally, I calculate and return the average score of the course.
