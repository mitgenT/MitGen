In the `get_course_average` method, the condition `<MASK>` should be `score >= 0` to include valid scores and ignore `None` values.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
    def get_course_average(self, course):
        total = 0
        count = 0
        for student in self.students.values():
            if course in student['courses']:
                score = student['courses'][course]
                if score is not None and score >= 0:
                    total += score
                    count += 1
        return total / count if count > 0 else None
```
