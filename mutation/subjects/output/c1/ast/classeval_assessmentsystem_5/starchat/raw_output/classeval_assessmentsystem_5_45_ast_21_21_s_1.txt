```python
    def get_all_students_with_fail_course(self):
        students = []
        for name, student in self.students.items():
            for course, score in student['courses'].items():
                if score < 60:
                    students.append(name)
                    break
        return students
```

In this case, the program has been completed by filling in the `<MASK>` in the `get_all_students_with_fail_course` method. The new logic checks if the score of a course is less than 60 before appending the student's name to the `students` list. This ensures that only students with failing scores in any course are included in the returned list.
