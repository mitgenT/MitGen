The given `get_all_students_with_fail_course` function is incomplete. The function should add only distinct student names to the `students` list. In Python, we can use a `set` to ensure uniqueness. Here is the correct implementation:

```python
def get_all_students_with_fail_course(self):
    students = set()
    for name, student in self.students.items():
        for course, score in student['courses'].items():
            if score < 60:
                students.add(name)
                break
    return list(students)
```

By converting the `students` set to a list before returning, we maintain the uniqueness of student names. If you need to continue with a set for some reason, you should remove the conversion line.
