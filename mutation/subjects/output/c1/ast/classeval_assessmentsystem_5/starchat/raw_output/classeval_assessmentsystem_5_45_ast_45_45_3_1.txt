The missing part of the code should be like the following:

```python
def get_top_student(self):
    top_student = None
    top_gpa = 0
    for name, student in self.students.items():
        gpa = self.get_gpa(name)
        if gpa is not None and gpa > top_gpa:
            top_gpa = gpa
            top_student = name
    return top_student
```

In this case, the missing `<MASK>` is just the `return top_student` line that completes the function to return the name of the student with the highest GPA. This line retrieves the `top_student` value, which is updated in the for loop whenever a student with a higher GPA than the current `top_student` is found. When the loop finishes, `top_student` will be the student with the highest GPA, so it is returned by the function.
