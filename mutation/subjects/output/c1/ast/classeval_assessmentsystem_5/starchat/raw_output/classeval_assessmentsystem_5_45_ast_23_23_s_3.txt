```python
    def get_all_students_with_fail_course(self):
        students = []
        for name, student in self.students.items():
            for course, score in student['courses'].items():
                if score < 60:
                    students.append(name)
                    break  # Add break to ensure only add student once when he fails a course
        return students
```
In the code above, I added a 'break' statement right after students.append(name). This change ensures that a student's name is only added to the'students' list once, even if the student fails more than one course.
This aligns with the task requirements, as the provided docstring asks to return a list of student names who have failed at least one course. With the current implementation, a student's name would be included multiple times if they have failed multiple courses.
Please review the updated code to ensure the functionality aligns with your requirements.
