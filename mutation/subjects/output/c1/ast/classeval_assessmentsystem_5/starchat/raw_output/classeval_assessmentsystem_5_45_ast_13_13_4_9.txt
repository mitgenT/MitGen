This solution calculates GPA by summing up all the scores for a given student and dividing it by the total number of courses taken. It checks if the student exists and has any courses, and handles the special case where there are no students or courses. The `get_all_students_with_fail_course` method checks each course for each student and adds the student to the list if they have a score less than 60. The `get_course_average` method calculates the average score for a specific course across all students. Finally, the `get_top_student` method finds the student with the highest GPA by comparing the GPA of each student in the system.
