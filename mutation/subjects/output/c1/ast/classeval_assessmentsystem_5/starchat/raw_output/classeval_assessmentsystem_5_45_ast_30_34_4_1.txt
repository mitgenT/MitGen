```python
    def get_course_average(self, course):
        total = 0
        count = 0
        for student in self.students.values():
            if course in student['courses']:
                total += student['courses'][course]
                count += 1
        return total / count if count > 0 else None
```

I filled in the `<MASK>` in the `get_course_average` method based on the provided requirements. This method will now calculate and return the average score of a specific course. If nobody has records for this course, it will return `None`.
