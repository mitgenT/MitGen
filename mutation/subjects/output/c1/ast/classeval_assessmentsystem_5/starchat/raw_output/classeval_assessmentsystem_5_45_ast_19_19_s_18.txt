In the given code, <MASK> must be replaced with:

1. `self.students.values()` in the function `get_all_students_with_fail_course()`. This will loop through all students and their courses.
2. `return students` after the loop ends in the same function.

The updated function is as follows:

```python
    def get_all_students_with_fail_course(self):
        students = []
        if self.students.values():
            for student in self.students.values():
                for course, score in student['courses'].items():
                    if score < 60:
                        students.append(student['name'])
                        break
        return students
```
