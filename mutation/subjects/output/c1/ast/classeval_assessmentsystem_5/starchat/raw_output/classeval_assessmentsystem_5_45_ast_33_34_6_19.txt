In the code provided, the only place where the placeholder `<MASK>` needs to be infilled is inside the `get_course_average` method. In that method, we want to only count non-None course scores. To do this, the line with `<MASK>` needs to be replaced as shown below:

```Python
if score is not None:
    if score!= 0:  # Change this line for other non-zero values if necessary
        total += score
        count += 1
```

The updated `get_course_average` method would then look like this:

```Python
def get_course_average(self, course):
    total = 0
    count = 0
    for student in self.students.values():
        if course in student['courses']:
            score = student['courses'][course]
            if score is not None:
                if score!= 0:
                    total += score
                    count += 1
    return total / count if count > 0 else None
```
