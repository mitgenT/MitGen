```python
    def get_top_student(self):
        top_student = None
        top_gpa = 0
        for name, student in self.students.items():
            gpa = self.get_gpa(name)
            if gpa is not None and gpa > top_gpa:
                top_student = name
                top_gpa = gpa
        return top_student
```

This code snippet adds the `get_top_student` method that iterates over all students to find out which one has the highest GPA by using the `get_gpa` method. If a student's GPA is higher than the current `top_gpa`, this student will become the new `top_student`. This implementation fulfills the requirement by finding the student with the highest GPA.
