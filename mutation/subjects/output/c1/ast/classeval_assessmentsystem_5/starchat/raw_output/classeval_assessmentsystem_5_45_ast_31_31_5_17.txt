In the `get_course_average` method, infill `<MASK>` as shown below:

```Python
def get_course_average(self, course):
    total = 0
    count = 0
    for student in self.students.values():
        if course in student['courses']:
            if'score' in student['courses'][course]:
                score = student['courses'][course]['score']
            else:
                score = None
            if score is not None:
                total += score
                count += 1
    return total / count if count > 0 else None
```

In the given code, it seems like there was a nested dictionary inside the `courses` dictionary. However, in this case, since there is no nested dictionary, I have taken a different approach where I check if `score` is directly available inside the `courses` dictionary for the given `course`. If it's not available, I assign `score` to be `None`.
