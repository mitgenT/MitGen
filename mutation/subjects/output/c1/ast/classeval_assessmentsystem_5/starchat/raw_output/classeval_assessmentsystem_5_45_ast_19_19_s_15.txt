In the `get_all_students_with_fail_course` method, you should fill in `<MASK>` as follows:

```python
if name in self.students:
    student = self.students[name]
    for course, score in student['courses'].items():
        if score < 60:
            students.append(name)
            break
```

The fixed code will look like this:

```python
def get_all_students_with_fail_course(self):
    students = []
    for name in self.students:
        if name in self.students:
            student = self.students[name]
            for course, score in student['courses'].items():
                if score < 60:
                    students.append(name)
                    break
    return students
```

Now the `get_all_students_with_fail_course` method will correctly collect students who have any score below 60.
