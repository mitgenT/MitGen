In the given code for the `get_course_average` function, the <MASK> should be replaced with an if-statement that adds the course score to the `total` variable if the course name matches the input parameter `course` and the course score is not less than 0. The `count` variable should also be incremented in this if-statement.

Here is the completed code:

```python
class AssessmentSystem:
    def __init__(self):
        self.students = {}

    def add_student(self, name, grade, major):
        self.students[name] = {'name': name, 'grade': grade,'major': major, 'courses': {}}

    def add_course_score(self, name, course, score):
        self.students[name]['courses'][course] = score

    def get_gpa(self, name):
        if name in self.students and self.students[name]['courses']:
            return sum(self.students[name]['courses'].values()) / len(self.students[name]['courses'])
        else:
            return None

    def get_all_students_with_fail_course(self):
        students = []
        for name, student in self.students.items():
            for course, score in student['courses'].items():
                if score < 60:
                    students.append(name)
                    break
        return students

    def get_course_average(self, course):
        total = 0
        count = 0
        for student in self.students.values():
            for course_, score in student['courses'].items():
                if course_ == course and score >= 0:
                    total += score
                    count += 1
        return total / count if count > 0 else None

    def get_top_student(self):
        top_student = None
        top_gpa = 0
        for name, student in self.students.items():
            gpa = self.get_gpa(name)
            if gpa is not None and gpa > top_gpa:
                top_gpa = gpa
                top_student = name
        return top_student
```
This code now correctly calculates the average score of a specific course and returns the average score only if the course has scores. It also returns None if no scores are available for the course. The `get_top_student` function now uses the `get_gpa` method to correctly calculate each student's GPA.
