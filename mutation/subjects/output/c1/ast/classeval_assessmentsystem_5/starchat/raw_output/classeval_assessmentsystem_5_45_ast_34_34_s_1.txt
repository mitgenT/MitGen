This program fills in the missing `<MASK>` in the existing Python class `AssessmentSystem`, which implements a student assessment system. It covers functionalities like adding students, adding course scores, calculating the Grade Point Average (GPA), finding all students with at least one failing course, calculating the average score of a specific course, and finding the student with the highest GPA. The code is optimized and follows Python best practices. It also includes comments for better understanding and maintainability.
