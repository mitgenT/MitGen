I will add the following code into the get_course_average method:

```python
if count > 0:
    return total / count
else:
    return None
```

This will calculate the average score of a specific course and return None if nobody has records in this course. The updated code is as follows:

```python
class AssessmentSystem:
    def __init__(self):
        self.students = {}

    def add_student(self, name, grade, major):
        self.students[name] = {'name': name, 'grade': grade,'major': major, 'courses': {}}

    def add_course_score(self, name, course, score):
        self.students[name]['courses'][course] = score

    def get_gpa(self, name):
        if name in self.students and self.students[name]['courses']:
            return sum(self.students[name]['courses'].values()) / len(self.students[name]['courses'])
        else:
            return None

    def get_all_students_with_fail_course(self):
        students = []
        for name, student in self.students.items():
            for course, score in student['courses'].items():
                if score < 60:
                    students.append(name)
                    break
        return students

    def get_course_average(self, course):
        total = 0
        count = 0
        for student in self.students.values():
            if course in student['courses']:
                score = student['courses'][course]
                if score is not None:
                    total += score
                    count += 1
        if count > 0:
            return total / count
        else:
            return None

    def get_top_student(self):
        top_student = None
        top_gpa = 0
        for name, student in self.students.items():
            gpa = self.get_gpa(name)
            if gpa is not None and gpa > top_gpa:
                top_gpa = gpa
                top_student = name
        return top_student
```

I've ensured that the given code accurately implements the AssessmentSystem class according to the provided docstring and method requirements.
