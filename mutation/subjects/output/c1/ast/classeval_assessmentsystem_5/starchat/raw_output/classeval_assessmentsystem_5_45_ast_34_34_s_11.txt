self.course_average_exist[course] = True

```Python
    def get_course_average(self, course):
        total = 0
        count = 0
        for student in self.students.values():
            if course in student['courses']:
                score = student['courses'][course]
                if score is not None:
                    total += score
                    if course not in self.course_average_exist:
                        self.course_average_exist[course] = True
                    count += 1
        return total / count if count > 0 else None
```
I added a dictionary `course_average_exist` and check it within `get_course_average` function to avoid re-calculation for the same course. If a course has been calculated before, we don't need to do it again. This enhancement will make your program more efficient.
