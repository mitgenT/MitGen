In the `get_course_average` method, you need to check if the score is not `None` before adding it to the `total` and incrementing the `count`. You can use this code:

```Python
def get_course_average(self, course):
    total = 0
    count = 0
    for student in self.students.values():
        if course in student['courses']:
            score = student['courses'][course]
            if score is not None:
                total += score
                count += 1
    return total / count if count > 0 else None
```

Now the `AssessmentSystem` class's `get_course_average` method is correctly implemented. It calculates and returns the average score of the specified course, or `None` if no score records are available.
