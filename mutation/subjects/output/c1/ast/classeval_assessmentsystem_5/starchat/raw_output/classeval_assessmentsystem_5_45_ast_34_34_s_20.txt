self.course_average[course] = 0  # Initialize count of course scores
count += 1  # Increase count for this course's scores
# Now, for course average, you can just use: self.course_average[course] += score
# After all scores are processed, calculate the average: self.course_average[course] /= count
# Then, in get_course_average method, return the calculated course average: return self.course_average[course] if count > 0 else None
