In the given code, you need to complete the `add_course_score` function. This function should add a score for a specific course for a student in the `self.students` dictionary. Here's how you can fill in the `<MASK>`:

```python
def add_course_score(self, name, course, score):
    if name in self.students:
        self.students[name]['courses'][course] = score
    else:
        print(f"Student {name} does not exist.")
```

With this implementation, the `add_course_score` function will add the score for the specified course for the student in the `self.students` dictionary. If the student does not exist, it will print a message stating that the student does not exist.

Here's the entire code with the `add_course_score` function filled in:

```python
class AssessmentSystem:
    def __init__(self):
        self.students = {}

    def add_student(self, name, grade, major):
        self.students[name] = {'name': name, 'grade': grade,'major': major, 'courses': {}}

    def add_course_score(self, name, course, score):
        if name in self.students:
            self.students[name]['courses'][course] = score
        else:
            print(f"Student {name} does not exist.")

    def get_gpa(self, name):
        if name in self.students and self.students[name]['courses']:
            return sum(self.students[name]['courses'].values()) / len(self.students[name]['courses'])
        else:
            return None

    def get_all_students_with_fail_course(self):
        students = []
        for name, student in self.students.items():
            for course, score in student['courses'].items():
                if score < 60:
                    students.append(name)
                    break
        return students

    def get_course_average(self, course):
        total = 0
        count = 0
        for student in self.students.values():
            if course in student['courses']:
                score = student['courses'][course]
                if score is not None:
                    total += score
                    count += 1
        return total / count if count > 0 else None

    def get_top_student(self):
        top_student = None
        top_gpa = 0
        for name, student in self.students.items():
            gpa = self.get_gpa(name)
            if gpa is not None and gpa > top_gpa:
                top_gpa = gpa
                top_student = name
        return top_student
```

This code implements an AssessmentSystem class with the required functionalities: adding students, adding course scores, calculating GPA, and finding students with failed courses, as well as calculating course averages and finding the top student based on their GPA.
