In your example, the missing part in the 'get_all_students_with_fail_course' function is:

```python
<MASK>
students = []  # Declare and initialize an empty list
```

As for your updated task, in the given code, the above line is missing for the same function. 

Here is the completed function:

```python
def get_all_students_with_fail_course(self):
    students = []  # Declare and initialize an empty list
    for name, student in self.students.items():
        for course, score in student['courses'].items():
            if score < 60:
                students.append(name)
                break
    return students
```

Rest of the given code is correct as is. You can run this in a Python environment and use it as an Assessment System. Just remember that the function `get_course_average` may cause a division by zero error if there are no courses or scores for a specified course. To prevent this, I would suggest checking if the count of scores is greater than 0 before performing division.
