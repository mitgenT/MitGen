```python
def get_course_average(self, course):
    total = 0
    count = 0
    for student in self.students.values():
        if course in student['courses']:
            score = student['courses'][course]
            total += score
            count += 1
    return total / count if count > 0 else None
```

In the given code, the `<MASK>` is replaced by `total += score` to accumulate the total scores and `count += 1` to count the number of students who have taken the given course. This is necessary for calculating the average score of the specific course.
