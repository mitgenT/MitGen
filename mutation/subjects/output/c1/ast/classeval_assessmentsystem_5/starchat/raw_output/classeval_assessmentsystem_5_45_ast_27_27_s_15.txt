In the `get_course_average` function, the missing part would be:

```Python
total = 0
if course in self.students[name]['courses']:
    score = self.students[name]['courses'][course]
    if score is not None:
        total += score
```

We need to initialize the `total` variable outside the loop and check if the course exists in each student's courses before adding the score to the `total`. Additionally, we need to ensure that we are not adding `None` values to our `total`.
