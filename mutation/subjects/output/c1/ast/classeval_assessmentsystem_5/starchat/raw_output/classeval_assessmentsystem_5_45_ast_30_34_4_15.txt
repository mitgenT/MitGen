The given code for the `get_course_average` method is missing an inner loop structure. This loop should iterate through each student's courses and check for the given course. If a matching course is found, the scores should be added to the total and the count should be incremented. Here is the corrected code:

```python
def get_course_average(self, course):
    total = 0
    count = 0
    for student in self.students.values():
        for course_name, score in student['courses'].items():
            if course_name == course:
                total += score
                count += 1
    return total / count if count > 0 else None
```

Now, the `AssessmentSystem` class has the correct implementation for the `get_course_average` method.
