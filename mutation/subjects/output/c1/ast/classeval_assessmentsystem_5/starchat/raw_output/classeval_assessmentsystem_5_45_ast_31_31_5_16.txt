In your code, replace the <MASK> line in the `get_course_average` method as follows:

```Python
if'score' in locals():
    score = locals()['score']
else:
    score = None
```

This line checks if the `score` variable has been defined or not before using it to avoid a `NameError`. If `score` is not defined, it sets its value to `None`. After that, it can be safely used in the calculation of the average. The complete method would look like this:

```Python
def get_course_average(self, course):
    total = 0
    count = 0
    for student in self.students.values():
        if course in student['courses']:
            if'score' in locals():
                score = locals()['score']
            else:
                score = None
            if score is not None:
                total += score
                count += 1
    return total / count if count > 0 else None
```

This ensures that your code handles all edge cases properly and provides the expected results for calculating the average score of a specific course.
