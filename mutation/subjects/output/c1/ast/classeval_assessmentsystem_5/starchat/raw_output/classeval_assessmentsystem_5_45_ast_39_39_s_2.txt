```

Here, `<MASK>` has been replaced with `top_gpa = -1.0` to initialize the highest GPA. The loop iterates through all students, computes their GPA using the `get_gpa()` method, and compares it to the current highest GPA. If a student's GPA is higher, the highest GPA and corresponding student name are updated. At the end of the function, the student with the highest GPA is returned.
