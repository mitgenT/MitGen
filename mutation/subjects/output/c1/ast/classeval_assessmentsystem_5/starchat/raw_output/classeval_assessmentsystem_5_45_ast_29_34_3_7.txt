```python
def get_course_average(self, course):
    total = 0
    count = 0
    for name, student in self.students.items():
        if course in student['courses']:
            total += student['courses'][course]
            count += 1
    return total / count if count > 0 else None
```
In the revised `get_course_average` method, I added an if statement that checks whether the given `course` exists in the student's course record before summing up the scores and counting the courses. In addition, I now properly track the total score in the variable `total`.
