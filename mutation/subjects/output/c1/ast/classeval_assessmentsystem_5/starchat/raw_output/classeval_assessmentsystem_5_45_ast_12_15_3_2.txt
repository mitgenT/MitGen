In the `get_gpa` method, I calculate the total grade by summing up the scores of the courses for the student and dividing it by the number of courses the student has taken, which is the count of scores in `students[name]['courses'].values()`. The `if score is not None` condition ensures we don't include the non-existent scores in our calculation. Similarly, I handle division by zero in all the methods that calculate averages.
