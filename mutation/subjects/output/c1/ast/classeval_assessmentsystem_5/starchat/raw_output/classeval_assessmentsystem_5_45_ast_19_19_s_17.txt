In the `get_all_students_with_fail_course` method, the missing lines should look like this:

```python
if self.students:
    for name, student in self.students.items():
```

This will loop through each student in the `students` dictionary. After that, for each course and score in `student['courses']`, it checks if the score is less than 60. If it is, the student's name is added to the `students` list and the loop breaks since we've found a failing course for this student. If no failing courses are found, the `students` list remains empty, and the method returns it. 

The complete method is:

```python
def get_all_students_with_fail_course(self):
    students = []
    if self.students:
        for name, student in self.students.items():
            for course, score in student['courses'].items():
                if score < 60:
                    students.append(name)
                    break
    return students
```
