In the `add_course_score` function, it should update the course score in the students dictionary. The code should be modified as follows:

```python
def add_course_score(self, name, course, score):
    if name in self.students:
        self.students[name]['courses'][course] = score
```

With this modification, when calling `add_course_score`, it correctly updates the score for the given course and student.
