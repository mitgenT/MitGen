    """
    Monocarp is playing a computer game. In order to level up his character, he can complete quests. There are n quests in the game, numbered from 1 to n.

    Monocarp can complete quests according to the following rules: 
    - the 1 -st quest is always available for completion;
    - the i-th quest is available for completion if all quests 𝑗<ihave been completed at least once.

    Note that Monocarp can complete the same quest multiple times.

    For each completion, the character gets some amount of experience points:
    - for the first completion of the i-th quest, he gets 𝑎iexperience points;
    - for each subsequent completion of the i-th quest, he gets 𝑏iexperience points.

    Monocarp is a very busy person, so he has free time to complete no more than 𝑘 quests. Your task is to calculate the maximum possible total experience Monocarp can get if he can complete no more than 𝑘 quests.

    Input
    The first line contains a single integer t (1<=t<=10^4) - the number of test cases.

    The first line of each test case contains two integers n and 𝑘 (1<=n<=2⋅10^5 ; 1<=𝑘<=2⋅10^5) - the number of quests and the maximum number of quests Monocarp can complete, respectively.

    The second line contains n integers 𝑎1,𝑎2,…,𝑎n (1<=𝑎𝑖<=10^3).

    The third line contains n integers 𝑏1,𝑏2,…,𝑏n (1<=𝑏𝑖<=10^3).

    Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5.

    Output
    For each test case, print a single integer - the maximum possible total experience Monocarp can get if he can complete no more than 𝑘 quests.
