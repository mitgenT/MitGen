```python
@staticmethod
def kurtosis(data):
    n = len(data)
    mean = sum(data) / n
    std_dev = math.sqrt(sum((x - mean) ** 2 for x in data) / n)

    if std_dev == 0:
        return math.nan

    third_moment = sum((x - mean) ** 3 for x in data) / n
    fourth_moment = sum((x - mean) ** 4 for x in data) / n

    kurtosis_value = (fourth_moment / std_dev ** 4) * 3

    return kurtosis_value
```

The `<MASK>` in the `kurtosis` method of the `DataStatistics4` class has been filled with the necessary calculation to determine the kurtosis value. The solution follows the docstring description provided.
