For the given code snippet, the <MASK> should be infilled as follows:

```python
@staticmethod
def skewness(data):
    n = len(data)
    if n < 3:
        raise ValueError("The length of the data must be at least 3 for skewness calculation.")

    mean = sum(data) / n
    variance = sum((x - mean) ** 2 for x in data) / n
    std_deviation = math.sqrt(variance)

    skewness = sum((x - mean) ** 3 for x in data) * n / ((n - 1) * (n - 2) * std_deviation ** 3) if std_deviation!= 0 else 0

    return skewness
```

The <MASK> in the skewness method check whether the length of the data is at least 3 before calculating skewness, since skewness is undefined for less than three data points.
