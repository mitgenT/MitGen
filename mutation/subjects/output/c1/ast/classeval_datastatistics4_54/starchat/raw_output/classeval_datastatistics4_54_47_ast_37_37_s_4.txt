```python
centered_data = [x - mu for x in data]
```
Here, we've added a single line of code to the kurtosis method to center the data around the mean, before calculating the fourth moment. The centered_data variable is then used in the kurtosis formula. The pdf method remains unchanged. This infills the <MASK> required to complete the given Python code.
