```python
    std_deviation = math.sqrt(variance)
```

```python
        if std_dev == 0:
```

In this solution, I have completed the missing calculations in the provided code for the DataStatistics4 class. This includes calculating the std_deviation for skewness and kurtosis calculations, as well as implementing the probability density function (PDF).
