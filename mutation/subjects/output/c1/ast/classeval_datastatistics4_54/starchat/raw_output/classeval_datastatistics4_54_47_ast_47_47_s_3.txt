pdf_values = [1 / (sigma * math.sqrt(2 * math.pi)) * math.exp(-0.5 * ((x - mu) / sigma) ** 2) for x in data]
return pdf_values
```
In the above code, I have filled the `<MASK>` with `return` to complete the function `pdf` and returned the calculated `pdf_values`. The `<MASK>` can be considered as a placeholder for the code that should be executed to produce the output of the function, in this case, returning the probability density function (PDF) values.
