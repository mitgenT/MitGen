```python
    @staticmethod
    def kurtosis(data):
        n = len(data)
        mean = sum(data) / n
        variance = sum((x - mean) ** 2 for x in data) / n
        std_dev = math.sqrt(variance)

        if std_dev == 0:
            return math.nan

        centered_data = [(x - mean) for x in data]
        fourth_moment = sum(x ** 4 for x in centered_data) / n

        kurtosis_value = (fourth_moment / std_dev ** 4) * 3

        return kurtosis_value
```

In the solution, the function to calculate the kurtosis of a set of data is completed by computing the fourth moment and standard deviation. If the standard deviation is zero, it returns `math.nan`. The rest of the program remains the same.
