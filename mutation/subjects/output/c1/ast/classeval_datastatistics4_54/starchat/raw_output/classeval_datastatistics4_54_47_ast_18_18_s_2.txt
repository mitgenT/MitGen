```python
        if len(data) < 3:
            return 0
```

Here, I added `len(data) < 3` as the condition to handle the case when the number of elements in the data for skewness calculation is less than 3, as it is not defined. For kurtosis, I didn't have to add any condition as we are considering all values in the data.
