In the given code, infill `<MASK>` in the skewness function as shown below.

```python
@staticmethod
def skewness(data):
    n = len(data)
    mean = sum(data) / n
    variance = sum((x - mean) ** 2 for x in data) / n
    std_deviation = math.sqrt(variance)

    skewness = sum((x - mean) ** 3 for x in data) * n / ((n - 1) * (n - 2) * std_deviation ** 3) if std_deviation!= 0 else 0

    if n > 3 and std_deviation > 0:  # For valid calculation of skewness
        return skewness
    else:
        return float('nan')
```

This change will make the skewness function return `NaN` (Not a Number) when the condition of having a standard deviation greater than zero and more than three data points isn't met. This aligns with the provided docstring example.
