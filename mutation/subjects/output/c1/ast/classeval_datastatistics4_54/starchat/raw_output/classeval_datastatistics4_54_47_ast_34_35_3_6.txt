In the code given, the function that needs to be filled with <MASK> is the kurtosis method. Here is the correct infilling:

## Code:
```python
@staticmethod
def kurtosis(data):

    n = len(data)
    mean = sum(data) / n
    std_dev = math.sqrt(sum((x - mean) ** 2 for x in data) / n)

    if std_dev == 0:
        return 0  # if standard deviation is zero, kurtosis is undefined

    centered_data = [(x - mean) for x in data]
    fourth_moment = sum(x ** 4 for x in centered_data) / n

    kurtosis_value = (fourth_moment / std_dev ** 4) * 3

    return kurtosis_value
```
The if condition checks whether the standard deviation is zero. If it is, it returns 0 as the kurtosis is undefined.
