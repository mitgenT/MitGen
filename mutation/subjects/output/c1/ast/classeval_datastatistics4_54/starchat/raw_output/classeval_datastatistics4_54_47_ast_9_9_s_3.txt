Infill `<MASK>` of the `correlation_coefficient` function based on the given docstring as follows:

```python
mean2 = sum(data2) / n
if mean2 == 0:
    mean2 = 1e-9
```

For the `skewness` function, no `<MASK>` is needed because it already includes the required calculations.

For the `kurtosis` function, no `<MASK>` is needed either, given the existing logic. 

The `pdf` function already follows the required calculations. No `<MASK>` is needed for this one as well.
