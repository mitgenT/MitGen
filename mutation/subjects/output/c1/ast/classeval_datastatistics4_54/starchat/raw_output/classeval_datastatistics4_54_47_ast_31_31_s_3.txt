```python
n = len(data)
if n > 1:
    mean = sum(data) / n
else:
    mean = data[0]  # Mean is the only element for a single-element list
```

This fills in the missing parts of the kurtosis calculation. If there's only one element, the function returns the kurtosis for that element, as kurtosis requires a set of multiple values.
