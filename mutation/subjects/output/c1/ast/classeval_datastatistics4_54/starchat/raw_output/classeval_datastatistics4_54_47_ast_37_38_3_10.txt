Infill <MASK> of the kurtosis method based on the docstring:

```python
    @staticmethod
    def kurtosis(data):

        n = len(data)
        mean = sum(data) / n
        std_dev = math.sqrt(sum((x - mean) ** 2 for x in data) / n)

        if std_dev == 0:
            return math.nan

        fourth_moment = sum((x - mean) ** 4 for x in data) / n

        if fourth_moment == 0:
            return 0

        kurtosis_value = (fourth_moment / std_dev ** 4) * 3

        return kurtosis_value
```
This change checks if the fourth moment (kurtosis) is zero before performing the calculation, to prevent a division by zero error.
