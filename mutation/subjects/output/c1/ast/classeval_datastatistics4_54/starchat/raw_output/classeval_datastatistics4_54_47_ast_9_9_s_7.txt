In the given code, for `correlation_coefficient()` function, check if `len(data2)` is not zero before proceeding:

```python
n = len(data1)
mean1 = sum(data1) / n
if len(data2)!= 0:
    mean2 = sum(data2) / n
else:
    return 0
```

Additionally, the `math.nan` return value in case of division by zero in `kurtosis()` function was missed in the given code. Please add it as:

```python
import math

class DataStatistics4:

    # Other methods remain the same...
    
    @staticmethod
    def kurtosis(data):

        n = len(data)
        mean = sum(data) / n
        std_dev = math.sqrt(sum((x - mean) ** 2 for x in data) / n)

        if std_dev == 0:
            return math.nan  # Add this line

        centered_data = [(x - mean) for x in data]
        fourth_moment = sum(x ** 4 for x in centered_data) / n

        kurtosis_value = (fourth_moment / std_dev ** 4) * 3

        return kurtosis_value
```

For all other methods, the given code already implements the respective operations correctly.
