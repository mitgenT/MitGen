In the correlation_coefficient method, first calculate the mean of data2 if it's not already done. Inside the class, add the following lines just after the line where `mean1` is calculated:

```python
mean2 = sum(data2) / n
if mean2 == 0:
    mean2 = sum(data2) / n
```

This checks if `mean2` is zero and recalculates it if necessary. Now, `mean2` will be used in the subsequent calculations.

The complete `correlation_coefficient` method should look like this:

```python
    @staticmethod
    def correlation_coefficient(data1, data2):
        n = len(data1)
        mean1 = sum(data1) / n
        mean2 = sum(data2) / n
        if mean2 == 0:
            mean2 = sum(data2) / n

        numerator = sum((data1[i] - mean1) * (data2[i] - mean2) for i in range(n))
        denominator = math.sqrt(sum((data1[i] - mean1) ** 2 for i in range(n))) * math.sqrt(sum((data2[i] - mean2) ** 2 for i in range(n)))

        return numerator / denominator if denominator!= 0 else 0
```
