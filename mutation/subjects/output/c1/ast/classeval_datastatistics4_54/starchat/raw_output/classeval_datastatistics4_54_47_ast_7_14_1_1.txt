In this output, I have completed the implementation of the `correlation_coefficient` method in the `DataStatistics4` class based on the provided docstring and example code. The method calculates the correlation coefficient of two sets of data by using the formula for calculating the covariance and standard deviations. I have also corrected the given code for calculating skewness and kurtosis. Lastly, I have completed the PDF method as per the given docstring, which calculates the PDF of a set of data under a normal distribution.
