Infilling <MASK> in the given code, you should see:

```python
if std_dev!= 0:
    if n < 3:   # Add this condition to handle the scenario when n is less than 3
        kurtosis_value = float('nan')
    else:
        centered_data = [(x - mean) for x in data]
        fourth_moment = sum(x ** 4 for x in centered_data) / n

        kurtosis_value = (fourth_moment / std_dev ** 4) * 3
else:
    kurtosis_value = float('nan')   # Return NaN (Not a Number) if standard deviation is zero
```

The code checks if the standard deviation is not zero before calculating the kurtosis. If the standard deviation is zero, it handles the scenario where n is less than 3 by returning NaN for kurtosis. This is consistent with the docstring provided, where kurtosis is defined as NaN when the standard deviation is zero.

The modified code for calculating kurtosis now ensures correct handling of the described scenarios.
