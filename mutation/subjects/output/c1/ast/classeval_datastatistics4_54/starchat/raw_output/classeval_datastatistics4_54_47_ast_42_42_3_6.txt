I will fill in the missing part "<MASK>" for the kurtosis method in your given code based on the provided docstring.

Firstly, let's define kurtosis in mathematical terms. Kurtosis is a statistical measure that describes the "tailedness" of a probability distribution. It measures the "bunching" or "flattening" of the tails of a distribution compared to a normal distribution. A normal distribution has a kurtosis of 3, which is known as "mesokurtic". Distributions with a kurtosis greater than 3 are called "leptokurtic" and have "fatter" tails, while distributions with a kurtosis less than 3 are called "platykurtic" and have "thinner" tails.

To calculate kurtosis using your given data, we need to use the following formula:

\[ Kurtosis = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} \left( \frac{X_i - \bar{X}}{s} \right)^4}{n} \times \frac{n + 1}{n - 1} - \frac{3(n - 1)^2}{(n - 2)(n - 3)} \]

where:
- \( X_i \) is each data point,
- \( \bar{X} \) is the mean of the data,
- \( s \) is the standard deviation of the data,
- \( n \) is the number of data points.

Here's the filled-in code:

```python
import math

class DataStatistics4:
    #... (rest of the class definition)

    @staticmethod
    def kurtosis(data):
        n = len(data)
        mean = sum(data) / n
        std_dev = math.sqrt(sum((x - mean) ** 2 for x in data) / n)

        if std_dev == 0:
            return math.nan

        centered_data = [(x - mean) for x in data]
        fourth_moment = sum(x ** 4 for x in centered_data) / n

        kurtosis_value = (fourth_moment / std_dev ** 4) * 3
        # apply the correction factor for finite samples
        kurtosis_value = (kurtosis_value * (n + 1) / (n - 1) - 3 * (n - 1)**2 / ((n - 2) * (n - 3))) if n > 3 else math.nan

        return kurtosis_value

    #... (rest of the class definition)
```

Now, you can use the `DataStatistics4` class with its methods `correlation_coefficient`, `skewness`, `kurtosis`, and `pdf` to perform advanced mathematical calculations and statistics as stated in the docstring.
