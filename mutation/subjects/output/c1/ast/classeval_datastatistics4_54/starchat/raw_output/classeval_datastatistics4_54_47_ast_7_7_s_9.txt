Infill <MASK> of the given code based on the Docstring:

```python
n = len(data1) if len(data1) == len(data2) else 0

if not n:
    raise ValueError('The input data lists must have the same length.')

```
This ensures that the code raises an error when data1 and data2 have different lengths. The correlation coefficient function will not execute correctly without proper handling of this condition.

Also, infill <MASK> in the skewness and kurtosis functions to avoid division by zero:

```python
std_deviation = math.sqrt(variance) if variance > 0 else 0

skewness = sum((x - mean) ** 3 for x in data) * n / ((n - 1) * (n - 2) * std_deviation ** 3) if std_deviation > 0 else 0

kurtosis_value = (fourth_moment / std_dev ** 4) * 3 if std_dev > 0 else math.nan
```

These added checks protect against potential division-by-zero errors, and provide a more meaningful return value when the standard deviation is zero (which can happen when the input data is a constant sequence).
