The `<MASK>` in the correlation coefficient function has been filled with an appropriate computation of the correlation coefficient, which involves the numerator and denominator as provided in the docstring. The numerator calculation has been completed by using list comprehension to find the product of corresponding elements in two datasets, and the denominator calculation has been completed by computing standard deviations of both datasets and multiplying them. The function returns the computed correlation coefficient.

The `<MASK>` in the skewness function remains unchanged as the calculation of skewness is correctly implemented without any `<MASK>`.

The `<MASK>` in the kurtosis function remains unchanged as the calculation of kurtosis is correctly implemented without any `<MASK>`.

The `<MASK>` in the pdf function remains unchanged as the computation of the PDF has been completed by iterating over data points to compute the probability density function (PDF) of each data point using the given mean and standard deviation. The function returns a list of PDF values for each data point.
