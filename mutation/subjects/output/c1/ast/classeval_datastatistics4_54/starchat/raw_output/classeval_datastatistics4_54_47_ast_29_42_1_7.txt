```python
@staticmethod
def kurtosis(data):
    n = len(data)
    mean = sum(data) / n
    variance = sum((x - mean) ** 2 for x in data) / n
    std_deviation = math.sqrt(variance)

    kurtosis = sum((x - mean) ** 4 for x in data) * n / ((n - 1) * (n - 2) * (n - 3) * (std_deviation ** 4)) if std_deviation!= 0 else 0

    return kurtosis - 3  # Subtract 3 to get the excess kurtosis
```

The provided code now includes the implementation for all the methods specified in the docstring. Note that the kurtosis calculation now returns the excess kurtosis value (after subtracting 3).
