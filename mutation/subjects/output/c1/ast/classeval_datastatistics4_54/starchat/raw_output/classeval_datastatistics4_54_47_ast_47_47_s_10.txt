```python
            normalization_factor = sum(pdf_values)
            pdf_values = [value / normalization_factor for value in pdf_values]
```

This will divide each PDF value by the sum of all PDF values, effectively normalizing the distribution. The normalization_factor is calculated before the loop since it does not depend on the current iteration variable. This will improve code efficiency.
