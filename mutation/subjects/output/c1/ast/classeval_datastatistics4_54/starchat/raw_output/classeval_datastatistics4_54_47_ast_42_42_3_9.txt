I will fill in the <MASK> in the last method named "kurtosis". In the docstring of the given code, there's a formula for calculating kurtosis:

Kurtosis = (Σ[(xi - μ)^4] / nσ^4) * 3

Here, xi is an element from the data list, μ is the mean, σ is the standard deviation, and n is the number of elements in the list.

Let's implement the formula in the code:

```python
    @staticmethod
    def kurtosis(data):

        n = len(data)
        mean = sum(data) / n
        std_dev = math.sqrt(sum((x - mean) ** 2 for x in data) / n)

        if std_dev == 0:
            return math.nan

        centered_data = [(x - mean) for x in data]
        fourth_moment = sum(x ** 4 for x in centered_data) / n

        kurtosis_value = (fourth_moment / std_dev ** 4) * 3
        return kurtosis_value
```

Now, the "kurtosis" method will correctly calculate the kurtosis of a given set of data based on the implemented formula.
