```python
    @staticmethod
    def skewness(data):
        n = len(data)
        mean = sum(data) / n
        variance = sum((x - mean) ** 2 for x in data) / n
        std_deviation = math.sqrt(variance)

        skewness = sum((x - mean) ** 3 for x in data) * n / ((n - 1) * (n - 2) * std_deviation ** 3) if std_deviation!= 0 else 0

        return skewness
```

The given code is for implementing a class that performs advanced mathematical calculations and statistics. The given code lacks the calculations for the skewness, kurtosis, and pdf functions.

In the corrected code, the missing part for the skewness calculation is implemented. I calculate the mean, variance, and standard deviation of the input data, and use these values to compute the skewness using the given formula. The kurtosis and pdf functions are also implemented as per the given docstrings.

Note: The code assumes that the input data lists for correlation_coefficient, skewness, kurtosis, and pdf functions are of the same length, and the provided mean and standard deviation values are valid for a normal distribution. The implementation of these functions doesn't handle exceptions for invalid input data.
