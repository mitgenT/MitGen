The `kurtosis` method in the `DataStatistics4` class should be completed like this:

```python
@staticmethod
def kurtosis(data):
    n = len(data)
    mean = sum(data) / n
    std_dev = math.sqrt(sum((x - mean) ** 2 for x in data) / n)

    if n > 3:
        centered_data = [(x - mean) for x in data]
        fourth_moment = sum(x ** 4 for x in centered_data) / n

        kurtosis_value = (fourth_moment / std_dev ** 4) - 3

        return kurtosis_value
    else:
        return math.nan
```

This completes the missing part of the `kurtosis` method to calculate the kurtosis of a set of data as per the docstring provided. The correction checks if the number of data points is greater than 3 before performing calculations to avoid division by zero and to return `NaN` as the kurtosis of a dataset with less than 3 data points is undefined.
