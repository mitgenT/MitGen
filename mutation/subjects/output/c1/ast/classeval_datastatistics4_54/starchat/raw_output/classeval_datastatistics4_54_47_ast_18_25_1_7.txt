```python
    @staticmethod
    def skewness(data):
        n = len(data)
        mean = sum(data) / n
        std_dev = math.sqrt(sum((x - mean) ** 2 for x in data) / n)

        if std_dev == 0:
            return math.nan

        centered_data = [(x - mean) for x in data]
        third_moment = sum(x ** 3 for x in centered_data) / n

        skewness_value = third_moment / (std_dev ** 3)

        return skewness_value
```

You can refer to this as the completed output. In the updated code, the `skewness` function calculates the skewness of a set of data by applying the necessary formula. Similarly, the other statistical functions like `kurtosis` and `pdf` have been completed, using formulas based on provided docstrings.
