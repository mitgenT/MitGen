```python
if n > 3:
    std_deviation = math.sqrt(sum((x - mean) ** 2 for x in data) / (n - 1))
```

The above code completes the function in accordance with the provided docstring by calculating the standard deviation with an adjusted divisor (n-1) for skewness and kurtosis calculations when the length of the data list is greater than 3. It maintains the original logic for correlation coefficient and probability density function (PDF).
