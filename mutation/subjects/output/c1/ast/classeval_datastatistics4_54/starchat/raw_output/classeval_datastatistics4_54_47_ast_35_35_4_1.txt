In the given code, I will fill in the missing parts for the `kurtosis` method:

```python
    @staticmethod
    def kurtosis(data):
        n = len(data)
        mean = sum(data) / n
        std_dev = math.sqrt(sum((x - mean) ** 2 for x in data) / n)

        if std_dev == 0:
            if n == 1:
                return float('-inf') # This line will be filled in for a single-element data set.
            else:
                return float('nan') # This line will be filled in for a multi-element data set with zero standard deviation.

        centered_data = [(x - mean) for x in data]
        fourth_moment = sum(x ** 4 for x in centered_data) / n

        kurtosis_value = (fourth_moment / std_dev ** 4) * 3

        return kurtosis_value
```

The above code will handle the special case of a single-element data set and a multi-element data set with zero standard deviation, returning appropriate results for kurtosis. If the standard deviation is not zero, it will calculate the kurtosis as usual.
