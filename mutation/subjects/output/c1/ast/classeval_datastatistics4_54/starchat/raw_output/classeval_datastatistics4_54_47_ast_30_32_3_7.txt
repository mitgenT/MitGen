```python
    @staticmethod
    def kurtosis(data):
        n = len(data)
        mean = sum(data) / n
        variance = sum((x - mean) ** 2 for x in data) / n
        std_dev = math.sqrt(variance) if variance!= 0 else 0

        centered_data = [(x - mean) for x in data]
        fourth_moment = sum(x ** 4 for x in centered_data) / n

        kurtosis_value = (fourth_moment / std_dev ** 4) * 3

        return kurtosis_value
```
This program completes the implementation of the `DataStatistics4` class by filling in the missing part for the kurtosis calculation in the `kurtosis` static method. The solution calculates the fourth moment about the mean and then returns the kurtosis value.
