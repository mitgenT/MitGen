Infill <MASK> of the given code:

```python
    @staticmethod
    def kurtosis(data):

        n = len(data)
        mean = sum(data) / n
        std_dev = math.sqrt(sum((x - mean) ** 2 for x in data) / n)

        if std_dev == 0:
            return math.nan

        centered_data = [(x - mean) for x in data]
        fourth_moment = sum(x ** 4 for x in centered_data) / n

        kurtosis_value = n * (fourth_moment / std_dev ** 4) - 3

        return kurtosis_value
```

I have completed the infilling of the <MASK> in the given Python program. The 'kurtosis' method calculates the kurtosis of a set of data following the given formula. If the standard deviation is zero, it returns NaN. The complete program is now ready for usage.
