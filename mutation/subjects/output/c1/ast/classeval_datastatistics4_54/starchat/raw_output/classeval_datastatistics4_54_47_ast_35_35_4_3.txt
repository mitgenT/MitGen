```python
    @staticmethod
    def kurtosis(data):
        n = len(data)
        mean = sum(data) / n
        std_dev = math.sqrt(sum((x - mean) ** 2 for x in data) / n)

        if std_dev == 0:
            return 3  # In case of standard deviation being zero, kurtosis is 3

        centered_data = [(x - mean) for x in data]
        fourth_moment = sum(x ** 4 for x in centered_data) / n

        kurtosis_value = (fourth_moment / std_dev ** 4) * 3

        return kurtosis_value
```

In the corrected `kurtosis` function, <MASK> is replaced with a return statement that returns 3 in case the standard deviation of the input data is zero, as per the convention of kurtosis being 3 for a normal distribution in such cases.
