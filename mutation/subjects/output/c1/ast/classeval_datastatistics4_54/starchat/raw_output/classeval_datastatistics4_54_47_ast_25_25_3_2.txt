In DataStatistics4, for skewness calculation, if the third moment is 0, we cannot define skewness. In such a case, you might want to return None or a specific value to indicate no skewness.

```python
@staticmethod
def skewness(data):
    n = len(data)
    mean = sum(data) / n
    variance = sum((x - mean) ** 2 for x in data) / n
    std_deviation = math.sqrt(variance)

    skewness = sum((x - mean) ** 3 for x in data) * n / ((n - 1) * (n - 2) * std_deviation ** 3) if std_deviation!= 0 else 0

    if skewness == 0:  # or any other suitable value or condition
        return 0  # or None
    else:
        return skewness
```

The provided code infills for the mask in the skewness method based on a typical approach to handle situations when the third moment (skewness in this case) is 0. This avoids dividing by zero and ensures that skewness is a meaningful value when possible, while still indicating a lack of skewness in a clear manner.
