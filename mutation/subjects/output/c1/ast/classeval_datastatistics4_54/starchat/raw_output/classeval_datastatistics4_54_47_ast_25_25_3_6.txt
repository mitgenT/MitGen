```python
if n > 3:
    return skewness
else:
    raise ValueError("Kurtosis calculation requires at least 4 data points")
```
This completes the `skewness` function as requested in the docstring. It will raise a `ValueError` with an appropriate error message if the number of data points is less than 4, as kurtosis calculation requires at least 4 data points.
