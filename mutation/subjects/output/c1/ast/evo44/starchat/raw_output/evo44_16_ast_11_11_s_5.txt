```python
new_base_num = str(remainder) if 0 <= remainder <= 9 else chr(remainder + 55)
```

The given code changes the base of a given number from one base to another. The function takes a string representing the number in the old base (`x`), the old base, and the new base as input. It converts the number to base 10 using the `int()` function, then converts it to the new base by repeatedly taking the modulo of the number and appending the result to the `new_base_num` string. The new digit (0-9 or A-Z) is determined using conditional statements. If a digit is not a number (0-9), it uses the ASCII values to convert it to the correct letter. The function returns the new base representation of the number as a string, or "invalid base" if the input `x` cannot be converted to an integer for the given base.
