        remainder = base_10 % new_base
        base_10 -= new_base
        if 0 <= remainder <= 9:
            new_base_num = str(remainder) + new_base_num
        if 10 <= remainder <= 35:
            new_base_num = chr(remainder + 87) + new_base_num 
    return new_base_num
```
This code works correctly as it converts numbers from any base between 2 and 36 to a new base between 2 and 36, following the instruction from the docstring provided.
