## Output
```python
def change_base(x: str, base: int, new_base: int):
    try:
        base_10 = int(x, base)
    except ValueError:
        return "invalid base"
    new_base_num = ""
    if base == 0:  # Special case for base 0, default to base 10
        base = 10
    while base_10 > 0:
        remainder = base_10 % new_base
        base_10 -= new_base
        if 0 <= remainder <= 9:
            new_base_num = str(remainder) + new_base_num
        else:
            new_base_num = chr(remainder + 55) + new_base_num 
    return new_base_num
```

In the given solution, I added the if-clause to handle the special case when base is zero, treating it as base 10. The rest of the program remains the same as in the example.
