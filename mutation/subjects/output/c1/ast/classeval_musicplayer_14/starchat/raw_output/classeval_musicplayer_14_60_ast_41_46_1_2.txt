```python
def previous_song(self):
    if self.current_song:
        current_index = self.playlist.index(self.current_song)
        if current_index > 0:
            self.current_song = self.playlist[current_index - 1]
            return True
        else:
            return False
    else:
        return False
```

In this code, I added the implementation for the `previous_song` method in the `MusicPlayer` class. This method finds the current song's index in the playlist and switches to the previous song if the current song index is greater than 0. If there is no previous song, it returns `False`. This solution fulfills the given docstring and provides additional functionality for the music player.
