Based on the provided docstring, we need to create a sequence where every `m`-th number is replaced with "Fizz". Since we start from 0 and use 1-based indexing, we should increment by `m` and check if the current index is a multiple of `m`. If it is, we append "Fizz", otherwise, we append the index value. Here's how to fill in `<MASK>`:

```python
    for i in range(0, n + 1):
        if i % m == 0:  # Check if i is a multiple of m (1-based indexing)
            result.append("Fizz")
        else:
            result.append(str(i))
```

The complete code would be:

```python
def string_sequence_modified(n: int, m: int) -> str:
    result = []
    for i in range(0, n + 1):
        if i % m == 0:  # Check if i is a multiple of m (1-based indexing)
            result.append("Fizz")
        else:
            result.append(str(i))
    return ' '.join(result)
```
