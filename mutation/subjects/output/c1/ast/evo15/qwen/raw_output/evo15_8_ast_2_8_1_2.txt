Based on the provided docstring, the function should generate a sequence of numbers and replace every m-th number with "Fizz". Here's how you can fill in the `<MASK>` parts of the code:

```python
def string_sequence_modified(n: int, m: int) -> str:
    sequence = []
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if (i - 1) % m == 0:  # Replace every m-th number starting from 1 (accounting for 1-based indexing)
            sequence.append("Fizz")
        else:
            sequence.append(str(i))
    return " ".join(sequence)
```

Now the `<MASK>` parts have been replaced with the correct logic. The function generates a list of numbers and replaces every m-th number with "Fizz" using the modulo operator. Finally, it joins the list into a single string with space as the delimiter.
