Based on the provided docstring, we want to create a string sequence where every `m`-th number is replaced with "Fizz". Here's how to fill in the `<MASK>` parts of the code:

```python
def string_sequence_modified(n: int, m: int) -> str:
    result = []
    for i in range(1, n + 1):  # Start from 1 (1-based indexing)
        if i % m == 0:  # Check if it's the m-th number
            result.append("Fizz")
        else:
            result.append(str(i))  # If not, append the number as a string
    return ' '.join(result)
```

Now, the `string_sequence_modified` function correctly implements the described behavior.
