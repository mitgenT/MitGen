Based on the provided docstring, we need to create a sequence of numbers from 0 to n (inclusive) and replace every m-th number with "Fizz". We can achieve this by using a conditional statement inside a loop. Here's how to fill in the `<MASK>`:

```python
def string_sequence_modified(n: int, m: int) -> str:
    sequence = []
    for i in range(0, n + 1):
        if (i + 1) % m == 0:  # 1-based indexing
            sequence.append("Fizz")
        else:
            sequence.append(str(i))
    if sequence:
        result = " ".join(sequence)
    else:
        result = "0"  # If n is 0 or m is such that no replacement happens
    return result
```

The `<MASK>` parts in the original code have been replaced with appropriate logic. The `sequence` list is created, and elements are added conditionally based on whether they should be replaced with "Fizz" or not. Finally, the sequence is joined into a string with spaces and returned.
