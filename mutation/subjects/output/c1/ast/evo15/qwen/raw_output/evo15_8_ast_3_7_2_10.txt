Based on the provided docstring, we need to generate a sequence of numbers and replace every `m`-th number with "Fizz". Here's how the code should look after infilling `<MASK>`:

```python
def string_sequence_modified(n: int, m: int) -> str:
    result = []
    for i in range(n + 1):
        if (i + 1) % m == 0:  # Use 1-based indexing
            result.append("Fizz")
        else:
            result.append(str(i))
    return ' '.join(result)
```
