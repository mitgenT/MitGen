Here's how you can fill in the `<MASK>` in the given code:

```python
def string_sequence_modified(n: int, m: int) -> str:
    result = []
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if (i+1) % m == 0:
            result.append("Fizz")
        else:
            result.append(str(i))
    return ' '.join(result)
```

The output code replaces the `<MASK>` with a loop that iterates through numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive) and checks if the current number is divisible by `m`. If it is divisible, it appends "Fizz" to the `result` list; otherwise, it appends the number itself. Finally, it joins the list elements with spaces and returns the resulting string.
