Based on the given docstring, we need to append the number `i` to the `result` list if it's not divisible by `m`, or append "Fizz" if it is. Since we have already checked for divisibility using `(i+1) % m == 0`, the condition for appending a non-"Fizz" number should be `not (i+1) % m == 0`. Here's the filled-in code:

```python
def string_sequence_modified(n: int, m: int) -> str:
    result = []
    for i in range(n):
        if (i+1) % m == 0:
            result.append("Fizz")
        elif not (i+1) % m == 0:
            result.append(str(i))
    return ' '.join(result)
```
