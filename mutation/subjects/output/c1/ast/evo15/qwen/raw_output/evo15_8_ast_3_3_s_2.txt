Based on the provided docstring, the code should iterate over the numbers from 0 to `n` and replace every `m`-th number with "Fizz". Since we're using 1-based indexing, we need to start the loop at 1. Here's how you can fill in the `<MASK>`:

```python
def string_sequence_modified(n: int, m: int) -> str:
    result = []
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        if (i % m == 0):
            result.append("Fizz")
        else:
            result.append(str(i))
    return ' '.join(result)
```
