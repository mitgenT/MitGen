Based on the provided docstring and the expected behavior, we need to concatenate the elements of the `result` list with spaces in between. Since we want to return a string, we need to join the elements and add a space before each element except the first one. Here's how to fill in `<MASK>`:

```python
    if result:  # Check if the list is not empty
        result = " ".join(result)  # Concatenate elements with spaces
```

The final code would be:

```python
def string_sequence_modified(n: int, m: int) -> str:
    result = []
    for i in range(n):
        if (i+1) % m == 0:
            result.append("Fizz")
        else:
            result.append(str(i))
    if result:
        result = " ".join(result)  # Concatenate elements with spaces
    return result
```
