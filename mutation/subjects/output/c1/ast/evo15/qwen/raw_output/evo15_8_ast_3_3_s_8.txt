Based on the provided docstring, we need to create a sequence that replaces every `m`-th number with "Fizz", starting from 0 up to `n`. Here's how you can fill in the `<MASK>` parts in the given code:

```python
def string_sequence_modified(n: int, m: int) -> str:
    result = []
    if n > 0:  # Check if n is positive
        for i in range(1, n + 1):  # Start from 1 (1-based indexing)
            if (i % m == 0):  # Check if it's the m-th number
                result.append("Fizz")
            else:
                result.append(str(i))  # Add the number otherwise
    else:
        result = [str(i) for i in range(m)]  # If n is 0, add m numbers up to m

    return ' '.join(result)
```
