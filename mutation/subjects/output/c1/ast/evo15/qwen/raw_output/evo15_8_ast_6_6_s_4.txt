Based on the given docstring, we need to append either "Fizz" or the number to the `result` list. Since we're checking if `i+1` is divisible by `m`, if it's not, we should append the actual number. Let's fill in `<MASK>` accordingly:

```python
def string_sequence_modified(n: int, m: int) -> str:
    result = []
    for i in range(n):
        if (i+1) % m == 0:
            result.append("Fizz")
        else:
            if i+1 < n:  # Check if there's a next iteration
                result.append(str(i+1))  # Append the number
    return ' '.join(result)
```
