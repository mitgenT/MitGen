Based on the provided docstring, we need to append either the number (i+1) or "Fizz" to the result list, depending on whether it's divisible by m or not. Here's how the code should be filled:

```python
def string_sequence_modified(n: int, m: int) -> str:
    result = []
    for i in range(n):
        if (i+1) % m == 0:
            result.append("Fizz")
        else:
            if i+1 is not None:  # Check if we should include the number
                result.append(str(i+1))
            else:
                pass  # Do nothing, as it's already covered by the Fizz condition
    return ' '.join(result)
```
