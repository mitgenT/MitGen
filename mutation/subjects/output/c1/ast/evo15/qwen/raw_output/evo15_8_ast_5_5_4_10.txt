Based on the provided docstring, we should replace every `m`-th number with the string "Fizz" and keep the rest as is. Here's how the code should be filled in:

```python
def string_sequence_modified(n: int, m: int) -> str:
    result = []
    for i in range(n):
        if (i+1) % m == 0:
            if "result.append('Fizz')" not in result:  # Check if already added 'Fizz' before
                result.append('Fizz')
        else:
            result.append(str(i))
    return ' '.join(result)
```
