Based on the provided docstring, we need to replace every m-th number with "Fizz" and handle the cases when `m` is not specified. Here's how you should fill in the `<MASK>` sections:

```python
def string_sequence_modified(n: int, m: int) -> str:
    result = []
    for i in range(n):
        if (i+1) % m == 0:
            if m is not None:  # Check if m is defined
                result.append("Fizz")
            else:  # If m is not specified, just append the number
                result.append(str(i))
        else:
            result.append(str(i))
    return ' '.join(result)
```
