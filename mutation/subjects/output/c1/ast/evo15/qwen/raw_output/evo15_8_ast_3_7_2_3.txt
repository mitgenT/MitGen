Based on the provided docstring, we need to replace every `m`-th number with "Fizz" in the sequence. Since we start counting from 0 and increment by 1, we can use a counter that increments after every iteration and checks if it's divisible by `m`. If it is, we append "Fizz" to the result, otherwise, we append the current number (converted to a string). Here's how to fill in `<MASK>`:

```python
    for i in range(0, n + 1):
        if (i + 1) % m == 0:  # Incrementing i by 1 due to 1-based indexing
            result.append("Fizz")
        else:
            result.append(str(i))
```

So the complete code is:

```python
def string_sequence_modified(n: int, m: int) -> str:
    result = []
    for i in range(0, n + 1):
        if (i + 1) % m == 0:  # Incrementing i by 1 due to 1-based indexing
            result.append("Fizz")
        else:
            result.append(str(i))
    return ' '.join(result)
```
