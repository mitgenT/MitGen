Based on the given docstring, we need to append either the number or "Fizz" to the result list, skipping the m-th number and incrementing by 1. Here's the infilled code:

```python
def string_sequence_modified(n: int, m: int) -> str:
    result = []
    for i in range(1, n+1):  # Start from 1-based indexing
        if i % m == 0:
            result.append("Fizz")
        else:
            result.append(str(i-1))  # Append the number before checking the condition
    return ' '.join(result)
```
