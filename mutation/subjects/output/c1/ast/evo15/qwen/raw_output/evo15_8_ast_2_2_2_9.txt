Based on the provided docstring, the `if` condition should check if `n` is greater than 0, and then it should initialize an empty list `result` to store the modified sequence. Here's how you can fill in the `<MASK>` in the given code:

```python
def string_sequence_modified(n: int, m: int) -> str:
    if n > 0:
        result = []  # Initialize an empty list for storing the sequence
    else:
        return ""  # If n is 0 or negative, return an empty string

    for i in range(n):
        if (i + 1) % m == 0:
            result.append("Fizz")
        else:
            result.append(str(i))

    return ' '.join(result)
```

Now, the function will generate the desired string sequence based on the provided inputs `n` and `m`.
