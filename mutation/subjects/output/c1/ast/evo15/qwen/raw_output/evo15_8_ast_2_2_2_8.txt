Based on the provided docstring and the code, it seems we need to check if `m` is not zero before starting the loop, and initialize an empty list `result` to store the sequence. Here's how you can fill in `<MASK>`:

```python
def string_sequence_modified(n: int, m: int) -> str:
    if m != 0:  # Check if m is not zero
        result = []  # Initialize an empty list for the sequence
    for i in range(n):
        if (i+1) % m == 0:
            result.append("Fizz")
        else:
            result.append(str(i))
    return ' '.join(result)
```
