Based on the provided docstring, the function should replace every `m`-th number with "Fizz". We can achieve this by adding a condition to check if the index is a multiple of `m`, and if it is, replace the number with "Fizz" or keep it as is. Here's how to fill in `<MASK>`:

```python
def string_sequence_modified(n: int, m: int) -> str:
    result = []
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if (i - 1) % m == 0:  # Adjust for 1-based indexing
            result.append("Fizz")
        else:
            result.append(str(i))
    return ' '.join(result)
```
