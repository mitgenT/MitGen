Based on the provided docstring, we should replace every m-th number with "Fizz" and maintain the rest as strings. Here's how the `<MASK>` should be filled:

```python
def string_sequence_modified(n: int, m: int) -> str:
    result = []
    for i in range(n):
        if (i+1) % m == 0:
            if i+1 != m:  # Don't replace the first occurrence of m with "Fizz"
                result.append("Fizz")
            else:
                result.append("Fizz")
        else:
            result.append(str(i))
    return ' '.join(result)
```
