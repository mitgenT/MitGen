Based on the provided docstring, we need to check if `i` is divisible by `m`, and if so, replace it with "Fizz". Here's how to infill the `<MASK>` sections in the given code:

```python
def string_sequence_modified(n: int, m: int) -> str:
    result = []
    for i in range(1, n + 1):  # 1-based indexing
        if i % m == 0:  # Check if i is divisible by m
            result.append('Fizz')
        else:
            result.append(str(i))  # Add the number as a string
    return ' '.join(result)
```

Now, the function will correctly implement the Fizz rule according to the description provided.
