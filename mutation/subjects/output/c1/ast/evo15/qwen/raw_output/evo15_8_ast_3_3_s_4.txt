Based on the given docstring, we need to check if `n` is greater than or equal to `m`, and then append either the number `i` or "Fizz" to the `result` list depending on whether it's the m-th number (1-based indexing). Here's how to fill in the `<MASK>` in the code:

```python
def string_sequence_modified(n: int, m: int) -> str:
    result = []
    if n >= m:
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if (i % m) == 0:
                result.append("Fizz")
            else:
                result.append(str(i))
    return ' '.join(result)
```
