Based on the provided docstring and example, it seems that we want to join the elements of the `result` list into a single string, separated by spaces, and add a trailing space if the length of the list is not 1. Therefore, we should infill the `<MASK>` parts like this:

```python
def string_sequence_modified(n: int, m: int) -> str:
    result = []
    for i in range(n):
        if (i+1) % m == 0:
            result.append("Fizz")
        else:
            result.append(str(i))

    # If the length of result is not 1, join the elements with a space
    if len(result) > 1:
        result = " ".join(result)

    return result
```

So the output code with `<MASK>` filled is as shown above.
