Based on the provided docstring and example, the code should append a space between each number that is not replaced with "Fizz". Therefore, we need to add `result.append(' ')` after the else block. Here's the infilled code:

```python
def string_sequence_modified(n: int, m: int) -> str:
    result = []
    for i in range(n):
        if (i+1) % m == 0:
            result.append("Fizz")
        else:
            result.append(str(i))
            # Add a space after each number
            result.append(' ')
    # If there's a remainder after the loop, remove the last space
    if result[-1] == ' ':
        result.pop()
    return ''.join(result)
```
