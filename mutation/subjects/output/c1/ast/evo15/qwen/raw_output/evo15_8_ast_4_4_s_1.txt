Based on the provided docstring, we want to replace every `m`-th number with "Fizz". Since we are using 1-based indexing, we need to check if `i % m == 0`. Here's how to infill `<MASK>` in the given code:

```python
def string_sequence_modified(n: int, m: int) -> str:
    result = []
    for i in range(1, n + 1):  # Start from 1 to include n
        if i % m == 0:
            result.append("Fizz")
        else:
            result.append(str(i))
    return ' '.join(result)
```
