Based on the provided docstring, we need to create a string with space-separated numbers from 0 to `n` and replace every `m`-th number with "Fizz". Since we are using 1-based indexing, we should add 1 to `i` when checking the condition. Here's how the code should be filled:

```python
def string_sequence_modified(n: int, m: int) -> str:
    result = []
    for i in range(1, n + 1):  # Start from 1 instead of 0 for 1-based indexing
        if (i) % m == 0:  # Use i directly without +1 since we've already incremented in the loop
            result.append("Fizz")
        else:
            if i < 10:  # Check if number is single-digit
                result.append(str(i))
            else:
                result.append(str(i).rjust(len(str(m * m)), '0'))  # Add leading zeros if necessary
    return ' '.join(result)
```

Here, I added a condition to handle single-digit numbers and used `str(i).rjust(len(str(m * m)), '0')` to ensure that numbers have the same width as the largest possible Fizz (which is `m * m`).
