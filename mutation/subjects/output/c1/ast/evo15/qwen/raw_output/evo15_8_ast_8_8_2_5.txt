Based on the provided docstring and the given code, we need to concatenate the `result` list into a single string with space delimiter, only if `n` is greater than 0. The modified code would look like this:

```python
def string_sequence_modified(n: int, m: int) -> str:
    result = []
    for i in range(n):
        if (i+1) % m == 0:
            result.append("Fizz")
        else:
            result.append(str(i))
    if n > 0:
        result = " ".join(result)
    return result
```
