Based on the given docstring, we want to check if `i` is divisible by `m`, and if so, replace it with "Fizz". Here's how you can fill in the `<MASK>` parts in the code:

```python
def string_sequence_modified(n: int, m: int) -> str:
    result = []
    for i in range(1, n + 1):  # 1-based indexing
        if i % m == 0:  # Check if i is divisible by m
            result.append("Fizz")
        else:
            result.append(str(i))  # Append the number if not divisible by m
    return ' '.join(result)
```

Now, the function correctly implements the described behavior.
