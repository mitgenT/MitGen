Based on the provided docstring, we need to add a condition to check if `i+1` is not divisible by `m`, and then append the index value to the result list. Here's how to fill in the `<MASK>` parts:

```python
def string_sequence_modified(n: int, m: int) -> str:
    result = []
    for i in range(n):
        if (i+1) % m == 0:
            result.append("Fizz")
        elif i+1 != m:  # Check if not the m-th number
            result.append(str(i+1))  # Append the number if it's not divisible by m
        else:
            pass  # Do nothing since it's already handled by the previous condition
    return ' '.join(result)
```
