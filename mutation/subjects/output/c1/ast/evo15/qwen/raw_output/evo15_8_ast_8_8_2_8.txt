Based on the given docstring and the code, it seems that the `string_sequence_modified` function is meant to create a sequence of numbers up to `n`, with every `m`-th number replaced by "Fizz". The `if <MASK>` condition checks if `n` is not zero before adding the last non-"Fizz" element. Therefore, we should append the current value `str(i)` if `n` is not zero. Here's how to fill in `<MASK>`:

```python
def string_sequence_modified(n: int, m: int) -> str:
    result = []
    for i in range(n):
        if (i + 1) % m == 0:
            result.append("Fizz")
        else:
            result.append(str(i))
    if n:  # Check if n is not zero
        result.append(str(i))  # Add the last non-"Fizz" number if n is not zero
    return " ".join(result)
```

The output code includes the check for `n` and appends the last element if necessary.
