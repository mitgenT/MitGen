Based on the given docstring, it seems like we need to join the `result` list with spaces and return it as a string if `n` is not 0. Therefore, the `<MASK>` parts should be filled as follows:

```python
def string_sequence_modified(n: int, m: int) -> str:
    result = []
    for i in range(n):
        if (i + 1) % m == 0:
            result.append("Fizz")
        else:
            result.append(str(i))

    # If n is not 0, join the elements with spaces and return as a string
    if n:
        result = ' '.join(result)

    return result
```
