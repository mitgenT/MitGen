Based on the given docstring, we want to replace every m-th number with "Fizz". The logic is similar to the bubble sort example, where we check if the index is a multiple of m. Here's how to infill `<MASK>`:

```python
def string_sequence_modified(n: int, m: int) -> str:
    result = []
    for i in range(n):
        if (i + 1) % m == 0:  # Add 1 for 1-based indexing
            result.append("Fizz")
        else:
            result.append(str(i))
    return ' '.join(result)
```
