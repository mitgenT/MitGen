The missing part in the given code is to concatenate the elements of the `result` list into a single string with spaces between them. Here's the filled-in code:

```python
def string_sequence_modified(n: int, m: int) -> str:
    result = []
    for i in range(n):
        if (i + 1) % m == 0:
            result.append("Fizz")
        else:
            result.append(str(i))
    result_str = " ".join(result)
    return result_str
```

Now the `result_str` variable will contain the modified sequence as a string.
