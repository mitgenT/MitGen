Based on the given docstring, we want to check if the current number `i` is divisible by `m`, and replace it with "Fizz" accordingly. Here's how the `<MASK>` should be filled:

```python
def string_sequence_modified(n: int, m: int) -> str:
    result = []
    for i in range(1, n + 1):  # Adjust the range to start from 1, as per the docstring's 1-based indexing
        if i % m == 0:  # Check if i is divisible by m
            result.append("Fizz")
        else:
            result.append(str(i))  # Add the number to the result if it's not divisible by m
    return ' '.join(result)
```
