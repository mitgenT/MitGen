Based on the given docstring, we need to create a sequence that replaces every m-th number with "Fizz". We can use a for loop and an if condition to achieve this. Here's how the code should be filled in:

```python
def string_sequence_modified(n: int, m: int) -> str:
    result = []
    for i in range(n + 1):
        if (i + 1) % m == 0:
            result.append("Fizz")
        else:
            result.append(str(i + 1))
    return ' '.join(result)
```
