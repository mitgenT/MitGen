Based on the provided docstring, we want to replace every `m`-th number with "Fizz" in the sequence. We can implement this by checking if `i % m` equals zero, and if so, insert "Fizz" instead of the number. Here's how to fill in the `<MASK>` parts in the given code:

```python
def string_sequence_modified(n: int, m: int) -> str:
    result = []
    for i in range(n):
        if i % m == 0:  # Check if it's the m-th number (1-based indexing)
            result.append("Fizz")
        else:
            result.append(str(i))  # Add the number otherwise
    return ' '.join(result)
```

Now the function should work as described in the docstring.
