## Output
```python
def string_sequence_modified(n: int, m: int) -> str:
    result = []
    for i in range(0, n+1):  # corrected range to include 'n'
        if <MASK>:
            <MASK>
            if (i+1) % m == 0:
                result.append("Fizz")
            else:
                result.append(str(i))
    return''.join(result)
```

In the given code, I just added `for i in range(0, n+1)` to include 'n' in the generated sequence. The rest of the program code already followed the guidelines provided.
