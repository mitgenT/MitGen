## Output
```python
def string_sequence_modified(n: int, m: int) -> str:
    result = []
    for i in range(n):
        if (i+1) % m == 0:
            result.append("Fizz")
        else:
            if i >= 0:
                result.append(str(i+1))
    return''.join(result)
```

In the solution, I added conditions to check if `i` is greater than or equal to 0 before appending the number to the result list. Then, if the conditions are not met, the number will be appended as a string to the result list. This ensures the given code correctly generates the expected output.
