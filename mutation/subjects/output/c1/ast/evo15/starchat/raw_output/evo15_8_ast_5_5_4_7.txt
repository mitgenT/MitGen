## Output
```python
def string_sequence_modified(n: int, m: int) -> str:
    result = []
    for i in range(n):
        if (i+1) % m == 0:
            if i == 0:
                result.append(str(i))
            else:
                result.append('Fizz')
        else:
            result.append(str(i))
    return''.join(result)
```

Here, I added the necessary conditional checks and replaced the placeholder `<MASK>` with the actual operations needed to achieve the desired functionality. This modifies the original code to produce a string sequence as described in the docstring.
