## Output
```python
def string_sequence_modified(n: int, m: int) -> str:
    result = []
    for i in range(n+1):
        if i!= 0:
            if (i+1) % m == 0:
                result.append("Fizz")
            else:
                result.append(str(i))
    return''.join(result)
```

In the provided solution, we replaced the `<MASK>` areas with the `for` loop and `if` condition to iterate through the range from 0 to `n` inclusive, and also to check if the number is divisible by `m` to replace it with "Fizz". The result string is built by joining all the elements in the `result` list with a space delimiter.
