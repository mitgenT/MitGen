## Output
```python
def string_sequence_modified(n: int, m: int) -> str:
    result = []
    for i in range(n):
        if (i+1) % m == 0:
            result.append("Fizz")
        else:
            if i+1 < m:
                result.append(str(i+1))
            else:
                result.append(str(i+1))
    return''.join(result)
```

In this case, <MASK> should be `result.append(str(i+1))` in both branches of the else statement. This ensures that the number from 1 to n (inclusive) is added to the result list unless it is divisible by m, in which case "Fizz" is added instead.
