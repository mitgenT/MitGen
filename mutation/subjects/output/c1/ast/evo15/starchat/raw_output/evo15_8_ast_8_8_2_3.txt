## Output
```python
def string_sequence_modified(n: int, m: int) -> str:
    result = []
    for i in range(n):
        if (i+1) % m == 0:
            result.append("Fizz")
        else:
            result.append(str(i))
    if result:
        return " ".join(result)
```
Infilling the mask in the given code, I added the `return` statement to make sure the function returns the expected space-delimited string. The `if result` condition checks whether the `result` list is empty or not before joining the elements. If `result` is empty, it means `n` is smaller than `m`, and there are no numbers to replace with "Fizz". So, in that case, no operation needs to be performed.
