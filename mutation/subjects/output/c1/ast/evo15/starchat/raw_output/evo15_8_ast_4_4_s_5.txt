```python
def string_sequence_modified(n: int, m: int) -> str:
    result = []
    for i in range(n):
        if (i+1) % m == 0:
            result.append("Fizz")
        else:
            result.append(str(i))
    return''.join(result)
```
In the given code, the <MASK> parts were replaced with `if (i+1) % m == 0:` and `result.append("Fizz")` to complete the FizzBuzz-like problem based on the given docstring. Now, the program checks if a number is divisible by `m` and replaces it with "Fizz", while appending the remaining numbers as strings. The final result is returned as a string of space-delimited numbers.
