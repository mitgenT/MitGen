## Output
```python
def string_sequence_modified(n: int, m: int) -> str:
    result = []
    for i in range(n+1):  # Add 1 to make it inclusive
        if i > 0:  # Check from 1st position
            if (i+1) % m == 0:
                result.append("Fizz")
            else:
                result.append(str(i))
        else:  # for i == 0
            result.append(str(i))
    return''.join(result)
```
In the given code, `<MASK>` is not applicable in this problem as we have a loop that iterates from 0 to `n` inclusive. So, we need to add the numbers from 1 to `n`, and replace every `m`-th number with "Fizz". I added a condition to check if `i` is greater than 0, since we want to start from 0, and then added the `if` condition inside the loop to check if the current number is divisible by `m`. If it is, we append "Fizz" to the result; otherwise, we append the number itself.
