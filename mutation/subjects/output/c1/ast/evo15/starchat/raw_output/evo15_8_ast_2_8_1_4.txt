```python
def string_sequence_modified(n: int, m: int) -> str:
    result = []
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if i % m == 0:
            result.append('Fizz')
        else:
            result.append(str(i))
    return''.join(result)
```

In this solution, I iterated through the range from 1 to n+1. For each number, I checked if it's divisible by m. If it's divisible, I added 'Fizz' to the result list. Otherwise, I converted the number to a string and added it to the result list. Finally, I joined all elements of the result list with a space and returned the result as a string.
