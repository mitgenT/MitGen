## Output
```python
def string_sequence_modified(n: int, m: int) -> str:
    result = []
    if n >= m:
        for i in range(1, n+1):
            if i % m == 0:
                result.append('Fizz')
            else:
                result.append(str(i-1))
    else:
        result = list(map(str, range(n)))
    
    return''.join(result)
```
The infilled <MASK> parts have been replaced so that the code correctly implements the given docstring. It correctly generates the modified string sequence, where every m-th number is replaced by "Fizz". If n is less than m, it simply converts the range from 0 to n-1 into a string sequence.
