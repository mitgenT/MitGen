## Output
```python
def string_sequence_modified(n: int, m: int) -> str:
    if n <= 0 or m <= 0:
        return ''
    result = []
    for i in range(n):
        if (i+1) % m == 0:
            result.append("Fizz")
        else:
            result.append(str(i))
    return''.join(result)
```

Explanation: The code uses two conditions to handle the cases of n=0 or m=0. If n or m is less than or equal to 0, it returns an empty string. Then, it iterates from 0 to n-1 and checks if the current number plus one is divisible by m. If yes, it appends "Fizz" to the `result` list; otherwise, it appends the current number. Finally, it joins all the elements in the `result` list with a space and returns the string.
