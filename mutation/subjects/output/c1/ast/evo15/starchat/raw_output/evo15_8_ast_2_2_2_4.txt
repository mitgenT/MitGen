## Output
```python
def string_sequence_modified(n: int, m: int) -> str:
    if n == 0:
        return ""
    
    result = []
    
    for i in range(n):
        if (i+1) % m == 0:
            result.append("Fizz")
        else:
            result.append(str(i))
            
    return''.join(result)
```

In the modified code, I added a check to return an empty string if `n` is 0. Then, I initialized an empty list `result` to store the numbers and "Fizz" strings. Finally, the for loop iterates through the numbers up to `n`, and the `if` statement checks if the current number is divisible by `m`. If it is, "Fizz" is appended to `result`, otherwise the number is converted to a string and appended. Finally, `' '.join(result)` is used to concatenate the elements of `result` into a single string with space delimiters.
