## Output

```python
def string_sequence_modified(n: int, m: int) -> str:
    result = ''
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if i % m == 0:
            result += 'Fizz '
        else:
            result += str(i - 1) +''
    return result.strip()
```

This solution iterates from 1 to n inclusive (1-based indexing), checks if each number is divisible by m, and adds "Fizz " to the result string when it is. For other numbers, it converts them to strings and appends them to the result. The `strip()` method is used to remove any trailing space before returning the final result string.
