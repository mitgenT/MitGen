## Output
```python
def string_sequence_modified(n: int, m: int) -> str:
    result = []
    for i in range(n):
        if (i+1) % m == 0:
            result.append("Fizz")
        else:
            result.append(str(i))
    if result:
        return''.join(result)
```

Infill <MASK> has been replaced by `return''.join(result)`. This code returns a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 upto n inclusive, but replaces every m-th number with "Fizz". The final string is constructed by joining the elements in `result` using a space as the separator.
