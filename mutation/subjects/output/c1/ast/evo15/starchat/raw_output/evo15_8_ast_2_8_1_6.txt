```python
def string_sequence_modified(n: int, m: int) -> str:
   result = ""
   for i in range(1, n + 1):
       if i % m == 0:
           result += "Fizz "
       else:
           result += str(i - 1) + " "
   return result[:-1]  # Remove the trailing space
```

Here, <MASK> is replaced with the Python logic to construct the required string output. Inside the for loop, it checks whether each number is a multiple of'm', if yes then it appends "Fizz" else it appends the number less by one to the result string and finally it returns the string with trailing space removed.
