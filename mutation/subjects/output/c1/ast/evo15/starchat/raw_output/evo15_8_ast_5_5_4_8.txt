## Output

```python
def string_sequence_modified(n: int, m: int) -> str:
    result = []
    for i in range(n):
        if (i+1) % m == 0:
            if i == 0:
                result.append('0')
            else:
                result.append('Fizz')
        else:
            result.append(str(i))
    return''.join(result)
```

In this solution, the logic for replacing every m-th number with "Fizz" is added within the if condition checking `(i+1) % m == 0`. If the current number `(i+1)` is divisible by `m` (it's the m-th number), then it checks if `i == 0` (i.e., it's the first number), if so, append '0', else append 'Fizz'. All other numbers are appended as string directly. The solution fulfills the requirement described in the docstring.
