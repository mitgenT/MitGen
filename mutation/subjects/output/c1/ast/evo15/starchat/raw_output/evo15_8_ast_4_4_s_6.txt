## Output
```python
def string_sequence_modified(n: int, m: int) -> str:
    result = []
    for i in range(n):
        if (i+1) % m == 0:
            result.append("Fizz")
        else:
            result.append(str(i))
    return''.join(result)
```

In this solution, I have filled the <MASK> for if condition which checks if the current number `(i+1)` is divisible by `m` or not. If it's divisible, then I appended "Fizz" to the result list. Otherwise, I appended the current number `i` as a string. This solution implements the required functionality for the given docstring.
