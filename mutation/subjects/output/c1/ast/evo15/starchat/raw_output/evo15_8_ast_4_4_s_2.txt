## Output

```python
def string_sequence_modified(n: int, m: int) -> str:
    result = []
    for i in range(n):
        if (i+1) % m == 0:
            result.append("Fizz")
        else:
            result.append(str(i))
    return''.join(result)

```
The mask was replaced with `(i+1) % m == 0` to achieve the desired functionality. This checks whether the current index (starting from 1 instead of 0) is a multiple of'm'. If it is, it appends 'Fizz' to the result list; otherwise, it appends the number itself as a string.
