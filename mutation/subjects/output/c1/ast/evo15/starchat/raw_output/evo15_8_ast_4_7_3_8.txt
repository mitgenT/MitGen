## Output
```python
def string_sequence_modified(n: int, m: int) -> str:
    result = []
    for i in range(n + 1):  # note the "+1" to include n in the output
        if (i + 1) % m == 0:   # "+1" to adjust for 1-based indexing
            result.append('Fizz')
        else:
            result.append(str(i))
    return''.join(result)
```

In this case, the <MASK> part replaced with code to check if the current number is divisible by m and append the string 'Fizz' instead of the number to `result` list. If not, just append the number in string format. Also, I added "+1" to the range in the for loop to make it inclusive of `n`.
