```python
def string_sequence_modified(n: int, m: int) -> str:
    result = []
    if n >= 0:
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if i % m == 0:
                result.append('Fizz')
            else:
                result.append(str(i-1))
    return''.join(result)
```

The `<MASK>` in the given code has been replaced to implement the logic based on the provided docstring. The loop iterates from 1 to n inclusive, checks if the current number is divisible by m, and if so appends "Fizz" to the result list. Otherwise, it appends the previous number to the result list. Finally, the list is joined with a space delimiter to form the final string.
