## Output
```python
def string_sequence_modified(n: int, m: int) -> str:
    result = []
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        if (i % m) == 0:
            result.append("Fizz")
        else:
            result.append(str(i-1))
    return''.join(result)

```
In this output, I've adjusted the code to reflect 1-based indexing for the m-th number as mentioned in the docstring. I've also corrected the range function to range from 1 to n+1, because in Python the upper limit is exclusive, so it wouldn't include the n-th number. The result is then properly converted to string representation and then joined with spaces into the final string.
