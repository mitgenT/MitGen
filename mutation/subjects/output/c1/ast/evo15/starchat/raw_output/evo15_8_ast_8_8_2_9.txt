## Output
```python
def string_sequence_modified(n: int, m: int) -> str:
    result = []
    for i in range(n):
        if (i+1) % m == 0:
            result.append("Fizz")
        else:
            result.append(str(i))
    if result:
        return''.join(result)
    else:
        return ""
```

The `<MASK>` in the original given code has been replaced with a conditional check to ensure that the `result` list is not empty. When it is not empty, the function will return a string containing the space-delimited numbers starting from 0 upto n inclusive with every m-th number replaced by "Fizz". If the `result` list is empty, it will return an empty string.
