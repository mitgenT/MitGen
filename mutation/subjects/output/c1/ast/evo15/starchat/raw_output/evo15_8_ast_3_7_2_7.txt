## Output
```python
def string_sequence_modified(n: int, m: int) -> str:
    result = []
    if m > 0:
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            if i % m == 0:
                result.append('Fizz')
            else:
                result.append(str(i - 1))
    return''.join(result)
```
I have completed the program by replacing `<MASK>` with the correct statements according to the given requirements. If `m` is greater than 0, the program loops through numbers 1 to `n` inclusive. For each number `i`, if `i` is a multiple of `m`, 'Fizz' is appended to the result list. Otherwise, `i - 1` (since 1-based indexing is used) is appended. Finally, the result list is joined into a single string with space delimiters.
