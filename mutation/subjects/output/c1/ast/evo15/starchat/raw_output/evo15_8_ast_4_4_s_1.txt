```python
def string_sequence_modified(n: int, m: int) -> str:
    result = []
    for i in range(n+1):   # range should go from 0 to n inclusive
        if (i+1) % m == 0:  # correcting the index (1-based to 0-based)
            result.append("Fizz")
        else:
            result.append(str(i))
    return''.join(result)

# test the function
print(string_sequence_modified(0, 3))
print(string_sequence_modified(5, 3))
print(string_sequence_modified(15, 3))
```

In the solution, I have corrected the range in the for loop to go from 0 to n inclusive, and adjusted the condition to check for Fizz when the (i+1)th number is a multiple of m (instead of checking i for Fizz) as per the docstring.
