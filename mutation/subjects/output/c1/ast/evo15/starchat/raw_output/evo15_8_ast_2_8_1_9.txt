## Output
```python
def string_sequence_modified(n: int, m: int) -> str:
    sequence = ''
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        if i % m == 0:
            sequence += 'Fizz '
        else:
            sequence += str(i) +''
    return sequence.strip()
```
This function iterates from 1 to `n`, and checks if the number is divisible by `m` (which is essentially every `m-th` number). If it is, it appends 'Fizz'to the `sequence`; otherwise, it appends the number to the `sequence`. After iterating through all numbers, it returns the sequence (stripped of extra trailing space). The output should match the provided docstring examples.
