## Output
```python
def string_sequence_modified(n: int, m: int) -> str:
    result = []
    for i in range(n+1):
        if i % m == 0:
            result.append("Fizz")
        else:
            result.append(str(i))
    return''.join(result)
```
In the revised version, I replaced the `if <MASK>` condition with a `for i in range(n+1)` loop to iterate over the sequence from 0 to n inclusive. Also, the conditional check `(i+1) % m == 0` is updated to check `i % m == 0` inside the loop since 1-based indexing is not required in this case.
