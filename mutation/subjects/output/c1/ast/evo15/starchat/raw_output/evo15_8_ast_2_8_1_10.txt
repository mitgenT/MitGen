## Output
```python
def string_sequence_modified(n: int, m: int) -> str:
    result = []
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        if i % m == 0:
            result.append("Fizz")
        else:
            result.append(str(i-1))
    return " ".join(result)
```

Note: The range starts from 1 and goes up to `n+1` (to include `n` in the sequence) since the problem implies 1-based indexing for the m-th number, i.e., the first number in the sequence is considered the m-th number. The `-1` is used to convert the index value to a 0-based index when appending the number to the `result` list. Finally, the numbers are joined together with a space using the `join` function.
