## Output

```python
def string_sequence_modified(n: int, m: int) -> str:
    result = []
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        if i % m == 0:
            result.append('Fizz')
        else:
            result.append(str(i-1))
    return''.join(result)
```
In this solution, we initialize an empty list'result' for storing the string representation of numbers from 0 to n. Then we iterate from 1 to n inclusive. If the current number 'i' is divisible by'm', we append 'Fizz' to the result list. Otherwise, we append the string representation of 'i-1' (to match 0-based indexing to 1-based indexing in problem statement) to the result list. Finally, we join the elements in the result list with a space and return the resulting string.
