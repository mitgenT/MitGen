## Output
```python
def string_sequence_modified(n: int, m: int) -> str:
    result = []
    for i in range(n):
        if (i+1) % m == 0:
            if (i+1) % 3 == 0 and (i+1) % 5 == 0:
                result.append('FizzBuzz')
            elif (i+1) % 3 == 0:
                result.append('Fizz')
            elif (i+1) % 5 == 0:
                result.append('Buzz')
        else:
            result.append(str(i))
    return''.join(result)
```

In the output, I firstly check if the current number (i+1) is divisible by m. Then, I further check whether this number is divisible by both 3 and 5 (the conditions for "FizzBuzz"), divisible by 3, or divisible by 5. If all conditions are met, I append the corresponding string to the `result` list; otherwise, I just append the number as a string. In the end, I use the `join` function to concatenate all strings in `result` and return the result as a space-delimited string.
