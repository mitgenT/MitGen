## Output

```python
def string_sequence_modified(n: int, m: int) -> str:
    result = []
    for i in range(n):
        if (i+1) % m == 0:
            result.append("Fizz")
        else:
            result.append(str(i))
    return " ".join(result)

```

In the given solution, we complete the program by joining the elements in the list `result` into a single string using the `join` function with a space as the separator, and return this resulting string. This gives the desired output as required by the problem description.
