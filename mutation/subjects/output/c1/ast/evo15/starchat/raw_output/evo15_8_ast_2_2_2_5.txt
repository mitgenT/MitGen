```python
def string_sequence_modified(n: int, m: int) -> str:
    if n <= 0:
        return ''
    result = []
    for i in range(n):
        if (i+1) % m == 0:
            result.append("Fizz")
        else:
            result.append(str(i))
    return''.join(result)
```
In this solution, I've added a condition at the start of the function to handle the case when `n` is less than or equal to 0. In the given code snippet, the <MASK> parts were missing, so I've added proper initialization and return statements to complete the function.
