Based on the given docstring, we need to check if either list is empty, and if so, we should continue with the other list. We also need to find the maximum length between the two lists. Here's how we can fill in the `<MASK>` sections in the code:

```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def interleave_and_concatenate(strings: List[str], integers: List[int]) -> Tuple[str, int]:
    max_len = max(len(strings), len(integers))
    
    # Check if either list is empty
    if not strings:
        interleaved = integers
    elif not integers:
        interleaved = strings
    else:
        interleaved = []
        
    for i in range(max_len):
        if i < len(strings):
            interleaved.append(strings[i])
        if i < len(integers):
            interleaved.append(integers[i])
    
    concatenated_string = ' '.join([str(i) for i in interleaved if isinstance(i, str)]) 
    sum_integers = sum([i for i in interleaved if isinstance(i, int)])
    return (concatenated_string, sum_integers)
```

Now the complete code has the necessary logic to handle the requirements described in the docstring.
