Based on the given docstring, we need to iterate over both lists simultaneously until one list is exhausted. Here's how you can fill in the `<MASK>` parts of the code:

```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def interleave_and_concatenate(strings: List[str], integers: List[int]) -> Tuple[str, int]:
    interleaved = []
    len_strings = len(strings)
    len_integers = len(integers)
    max_len = max(len_strings, len_integers)

    # If both lists have elements left to interleave
    if len_strings > 0 and len_integers > 0:
        for i in range(max_len):
            if i < len_strings:
                interleaved.append(strings[i])
            if i < len_integers:
                interleaved.append(integers[i])

    concatenated_string = ' '.join([str(i) for i in interleaved if isinstance(i, str)])
    sum_integers = sum([i for i in interleaved if isinstance(i, int)])
    return (concatenated_string, sum_integers)
```

Now the code completes the task described in the docstring by iterating through both lists and appending their elements to the `interleaved` list until one list is empty. After that, it calculates the concatenated string and sum of integers as required.
