```python
from typing import List, Union

def intersperse(numbers: List[Union[int, float]], delimeter: Union[int, float], limit: int) -> List[Union[int, float]]:
    result = []
    for i, num in enumerate(numbers):
        result.append(num)
        if i < len(numbers) - 1 and i < limit:
            result.append(delimeter)
    return result
```
In the output, `<MASK>` has been replaced with the code that loops through the 'numbers' list, appends each element to the'result' list, and inserts the 'delimeter' between consecutive elements up to 'limit' times. This solution ensures that the function only performs the intersperse operation up to the specified limit.
