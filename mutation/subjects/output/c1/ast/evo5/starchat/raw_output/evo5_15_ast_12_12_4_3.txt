## Output
```python
from typing import List, Union
def intersperse(numbers: List[Union[int, float]], delimeter: Union[int, float], limit: int) -> List[Union[int, float]]:
    set_float = False
    if type(delimeter) == float:
        set_float = True
    result = []
    limit = min(limit, len(numbers) - 1) 
    for i in range(len(numbers) - 1):
        if set_float:
            result.append(float(numbers[i]))
        else:
            if i % 2 == 0:
                result.append(numbers[i])
        if i < limit:
            result.append(delimeter)
    return result
```
In the output, <MASK> is replaced with the condition (i % 2 == 0) which ensures that the number is inserted between every two consecutive elements. If delimeter is a float, the output list is also set to float type. The limit for number of insertions is also considered and only the first limit pairs of consecutive numbers have the delimeter inserted between them.
