## Output
```python
from typing import List, Union
def intersperse(numbers: List[Union[int, float]], delimeter: Union[int, float], limit: int) -> List[Union[int, float]]:
    result = []
    count = 0
    for num in numbers:
        result.append(num)
        if count < limit and num!= numbers[-1]:  # Don't add delimeter for the last element
            result.append(delimeter)
            count += 1
    return result
```

Infill the `<MASK>` section to iterate through the `numbers` list and append each number to `result`. If the `count` is less than `limit` and the number isn't the last element of `numbers`, then append the `delimeter` to `result` and increment `count`. This will effectively insert the `delimeter` between every two consecutive elements of the input list `numbers`, but only up to `limit` times. If the `delimeter` is a float, the output list will also be in float. The output list `result` is returned as the final result.
