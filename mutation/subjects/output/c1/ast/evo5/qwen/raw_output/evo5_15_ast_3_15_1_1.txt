Based on the provided docstring, we need to insert the `delimeter` between every two consecutive elements of the `numbers` list, up to `limit` times. Here's the code with the `<MASK>` filled in:

```python
from typing import List, Union

def intersperse(numbers: List[Union[int, float]], delimiter: Union[int, float], limit: int) -> List[Union[int, float]]:
    result = []
    count = 0

    for i, num in enumerate(numbers):
        if count < limit and i < len(numbers) - 1:
            result.append(num)
            result.append(delimiter)
            count += 1
        else:
            result.append(num)

    # If the last element was not appended due to the limit, add it directly
    if count < limit and i == len(numbers) - 1:
        result.pop()  # Remove the last delimiter

    return result
```

Now the code implements the desired functionality as described in the docstring.
