Based on the given docstring, the correct code to fill in the `<MASK>` is:

```python
    for i in range(limit):
        result.append(numbers[i + 1] if i + 1 < len(numbers) else None)
``` 

This ensures that the delimeter is only inserted up to `limit` times, and it handles the case where `limit` is less than the length of `numbers`. The `None` check is added to avoid going out of bounds when `i + 1` reaches the end of the list.
