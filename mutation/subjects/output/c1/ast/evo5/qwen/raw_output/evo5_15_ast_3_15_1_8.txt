Based on the provided docstring, we need to insert the `delimeter` between every two consecutive elements of the input list `numbers`, up to `limit` times. If `limit` is less than the length of `numbers` minus one, only the first `limit` pairs should have the delimiter inserted. Here's the completed code:

```python
from typing import List, Union

def intersperse(numbers: List[Union[int, float]], delimeter: Union[int, float], limit: int) -> List[Union[int, float]]:
    result = []
    for i in range(min(limit, len(numbers) - 1)):
        result.extend([numbers[i], delimeter])
    
    # If there's more delimeters left after the first 'limit' iterations, add the last element without delimiter
    if limit < len(numbers) - 1:
        result.append(numbers[-1])

    # If the delimiter is a float, make sure the output list is also in float
    if isinstance(delimeter, float):
        result = [float(i) for i in result]

    return result
```

Now, the function `intersperse` takes the necessary actions according to the description provided in the docstring.
