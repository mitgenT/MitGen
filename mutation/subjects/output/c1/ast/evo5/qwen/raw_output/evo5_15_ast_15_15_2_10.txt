Here's how you can fill in the `<MASK>` in the given code:

```python
    if i < limit:
        result.append(delimeter)
    else:
        if set_float:
            result.append(float(numbers[i]))
        else:
            result.append(numbers[i])
```

The logic here is that after the specified limit has been reached (inclusive), we no longer need to insert the delimiter, so we append the remaining elements from the input list to the result without the delimiter. The check for `set_float` ensures that if the delimiter is a float, the appended elements from the input list are converted to floats as well.
