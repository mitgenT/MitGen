Based on the provided docstring, the function should insert the `delimeter` between every two consecutive elements of the `numbers` list, up to `limit` times. If `delimeter` is a float, the output list should also contain float values. Here's how the code should be completed:

```python
    for _ in range(limit):
        result.append(delimeter)
    if set_float:
        result.append(float(delimeter))
    else:
        result.append(delimeter)
```

The `_` in the for loop is used because we don't actually use the loop variable here; we just want to iterate `limit` times. The condition at the end ensures that if `set_float` is true (meaning `delimeter` is a float), we append a float version of the delimeter to the result.
