Based on the provided docstring, we should insert the `delimeter` between every two consecutive elements of the `numbers` list, up to `limit` times. Since we're dealing with a for loop and the condition to stop inserting the `delimeter`, the correct code to infill `<MASK>` is:

```python
result.append(numbers[i + 1])
```

This is because after appending `numbers[i + 1]` to the `result`, we can then append the `delimeter` if it's within the limit.

So the complete code would be:

```python
from typing import List, Union
def intersperse(numbers: List[Union[int, float]], delimeter: Union[int, float], limit: int) -> List[Union[int, float]]:
    set_float = False
    if type(delimeter) == float:
        set_float = True
    result = []
    limit = min(limit, len(numbers) - 1) 
    for i in range(len(numbers) - 1):
        result.append(numbers[i + 1])
        if i < limit:
            result.append(delimeter)
    return result
```
