Based on the given docstring, we need to insert the `delimeter` between every two consecutive elements of the `numbers` list, but only up to `limit` times. If `delimeter` is a float, the output list should also be in float format. Here's how to fill in the `<MASK>` parts of the code:

```python
from typing import List, Union
def intersperse(numbers: List[Union[int, float]], delimeter: Union[int, float], limit: int) -> List[Union[int, float]]:
    set_float = False
    if type(delimeter) == float:
        set_float = True
    if limit > 0:  # Check if there's at least one insertion required
        result = []  # Create an empty list for the result
        for i in range(len(numbers) - 1):
            if set_float:
                result.append(float(numbers[i]))
            else:
                result.append(numbers[i])
            if i < limit - 1:  # Don't append the delimeter after the last pair
                result.append(delimeter)
    else:
        result = numbers  # If limit is 0, just return the input list without any changes

    return result
```

Now the `<MASK>` parts have been replaced with appropriate code according to the requirements described in the docstring.
