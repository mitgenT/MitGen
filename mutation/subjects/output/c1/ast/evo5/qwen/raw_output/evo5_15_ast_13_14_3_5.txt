Based on the provided docstring, we need to insert the `delimeter` between every two consecutive elements of the `numbers` list, up to `limit` times. Since we've already considered the case where `set_float` is true (i.e., `delimeter` is a float), we can simply append the `delimeter` after each element, except for the last one, which doesn't require the delimiter after it.

Here's the code with `<MASK>` infilled:

```python
from typing import List, Union
def intersperse(numbers: List[Union[int, float]], delimeter: Union[int, float], limit: int) -> List[Union[int, float]]:
    set_float = False
    if type(delimeter) == float:
        set_float = True
    result = []
    limit = min(limit, len(numbers) - 1) 
    for i in range(len(numbers) - 1):
        if set_float:
            result.append(float(numbers[i]))
        else:
            result.append(numbers[i])
        if i < limit:
            result.append(delimeter)
    if not set_float:
        result.append(numbers[-1])  # Include the last element if it's not a float
    return result
```

This code now correctly inserts the `delimeter` as described in the docstring.
