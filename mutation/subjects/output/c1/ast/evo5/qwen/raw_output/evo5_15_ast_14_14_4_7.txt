Here's how you can fill in the `<MASK>` parts of the code based on the given docstring:

```python
from typing import List, Union
def intersperse(numbers: List[Union[int, float]], delimeter: Union[int, float], limit: int) -> List[Union[int, float]]:
    set_float = False
    if type(delimeter) == float:
        set_float = True
    result = []
    limit = min(limit, len(numbers) - 1) 

    for i in range(len(numbers) - 1):
        if set_float:
            result.append(float(numbers[i]))
        else:
            result.append(numbers[i])
        
        if i < limit:
            result.append(delimeter)

    # Add the last element if it's not the delimiter
    if set_float and (i + 1) != limit or not set_float and i + 1 != len(numbers):
        result.append(numbers[-1])

    return result
```

The logic here is that we want to insert the `delimeter` after each pair of consecutive elements, up to `limit` times. Since we already append the current number, we append the `delimeter` immediately afterward. For float delimiters, we ensure to convert the number to float before appending. After the loop, we check if there's one more element to add (which wouldn't have been appended due to the delimiter) and append it accordingly.
