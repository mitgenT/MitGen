Based on the provided docstring and the code, it seems we need to insert the `delimeter` between consecutive elements of the `numbers` list, up to `limit` times. Here's how to fill in the `<MASK>` in the code:

```python
from typing import List, Union
def intersperse(numbers: List[Union[int, float]], delimeter: Union[int, float], limit: int) -> List[Union[int, float]]:
    set_float = False
    if type(delimeter) == float:
        set_float = True
    result = []
    limit = min(limit, len(numbers) - 1) 
    for i in range(len(numbers) - 1):
        if set_float:
            result.append(float(numbers[i]))
        else:
            result.append(numbers[i])
        if i < limit:
            result.append(delimeter)
            # No need to assign the value back since we've already appended it
    if set_float and not isinstance(result[-1], float):  # Check if we need to append a final float delimiter if it wasn't already there
        result.append(float(delimeter))
    return result
```

This fills in the `<MASK>` with the correct operation for appending the `delimeter` to the `result` list. The last check is for the case where we're using a float delimiter and the last element in the result isn't already a float, in which case we append a final float delimiter.
